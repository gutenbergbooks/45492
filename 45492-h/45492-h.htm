<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A REJECTED PROPOSAL.</p>


<p>"No, Frank, most decidedly not. I must say
that I am more than surprised that you should
have had the audacity to even think for an instant
that such a thing could be."</p>

<p>"But we love each other most sincerely, Mr.
Callister, and you know as well as I do that there
was a time when, with your approval, I was allowed
to consider Edna as my future wife."</p>

<p>"That may be, young man, that may be&mdash;I
will even go so far as to admit that such was the
case. But circumstances alter cases, and I am
inclined to think that I could do somewhat better
than to bestow the hand of my only daughter
upon a bank clerk at a beggarly salary of twelve
hundred a year."</p>

<p>"I am assistant cashier of Webster National
Bank, and my salary is quite enough for a young
couple to get along on with economy; besides, I
have prospects of promotion&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Had, you mean. A year ago such was the
case, Frank Mansfield. From what I have recently
heard of your career, your drinking, gambling
and nightly carousals, I am inclined to
doubt if your prospects amount to much now."</p>

<p>It was Mr. Elijah Callister, the rich Wall street
stock operator, who spoke these words, the person
to whom they were addressed being Frank
Mansfield, a handsome youth of twenty-one.</p>

<p>The scene was Mr. Callister's office on Broad
street, in one of the nine-story buildings just below
Wall, and the time the close of the short
winter's day, December 22, 1884.</p>

<p>Now, in thus demanding the hand of Miss
Edna Callister, Frank Mansfield was by no means
as presumptuous as at first glance might seem.</p>

<p>But little less than five years previous to the
date just mentioned, the father of this young
man had been a wealthy and honored merchant,
and the stock operator's most intimate friend.</p>

<p>Their business interests to a great extent in
common, their elegant residences on Fifth avenue
side by side, and their children&mdash;in each case
the only child the friends possessed&mdash;had been
taught to look forward to the day when they
should marry with their parent's full consent.</p>

<p>To-day all was different, and Edgar Mansfield
lay in a dishonored grave, his wife, driven mad
by the reverses of fortune and the loss of a kind
and loving husband, had disappeared from the
circle of friends in which she had long figured as
a leading spirit, while Frank had been thrown to
shift for himself upon the cold charity of an unsympathizing
world.</p>

<p>All this happened in the spring of 1879, which,
all will be seen, was five years before our story
begins.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Elijah Callister had flourished,
even as his friend Mansfield had slipped and fallen.</p>

<p>While Frank, who had obtained a position in
the Webster National Bank, had been working
hard to advance himself, with occasional slips
and frequent lapses into dissipation and folly&mdash;always
bitterly repented of when committed and
it was too late&mdash;the father of Edna Callister had
steadily increased in influence and wealth.</p>

<p>He was honored among business men, a pillar
in the church, and high in social circles, and yet
he had turned his back completely upon the son
of his old-time friend, having even gone so far
as to forbid him entrance to his home.</p>

<p>That the course he had pursued had not prevented
the love which had existed from childhood
between the youthful pair from developing
as time went on, is evident from the conversation
in which we now find the highly respectable
Mr. Callister and the son of his former friend engaged.</p>

<p>"I am hardly as bad a fellow as you would
make me out, Mr. Callister," answered Frank,
flushing to the eyes at the stock speculator's last
remark. "I have been a little wild and imprudent,
I'll admit, but I've made up my mind to reform,
and with Edna for my wife&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!"</p>

<p>Mr. Callister had brought his fist down upon
the desk with a bang.</p>

<p>"My daughter shall marry no pauper, Mr.
Mansfield!" he exclaimed, with emphasis. "Come
to me with proof that you are possessed of at
least ten thousand dollars of your own, and I
will listen to you&mdash;not before. At the present
time I doubt if you can produce ten thousand
cents."</p>

<p>"And this is final?"</p>

<p>The face of Frank Mansfield was very pale as
he spoke.</p>

<p>"It is. Reform your habits of life, go to
work and advance yourself, make money somehow,
anyhow, so that you make it, and then, if
Edna has not previously found some one more
worthy of her, as I have no doubt she will, I will
give your proposal the consideration it deserves.
Now I must bid you good-night."</p>

<p>Without a word the young man turned upon
his heel and passed out of the office.</p>

<p>Listening for a moment to his retreating footsteps
as they died away through the corridor,
Mr. Elijah Callister arose, drew on his overcoat,
adjusted his shiny beaver at the proper angle
upon his head, and taking up his walking stick,
prepared to start for his palatial home with a
general air of respectable business solidity standing
forth from every portion of his portly presence
from the crown of his hat to the soles of his
well-polished shoes.</p>

<p>"That settles him for the day," he muttered,
as he cast his eye about the office to see that
everything was as it should be for the night;
"by to-morrow, unless I greatly mistake, the
young gentleman will have most effectually
settled himself. I have nothing against Frank,
nothing in the world, but of late he has become
altogether too inquisitive, and there is nothing
for it but to remove him from my path."</p>

<p>"Though I don't doubt in the least," he added,
meditatively, as he locked the office door
behind him, "that when she hears what has
happened, she will kick up a deuce of a row."</p>

<p>And the respectable Mr. Callister, the last
man in the world who among the brethren of
the Tenth Baptist Church on Murray Hill, in
which he was a bright and shining light, would
have been suspected of such a thing, stepped
into the elevator, passed out of the nine-story
building into Broad street, and, slipping around
the corner into a little alley, hurriedly descended
the steps of a basement groggery, and walking
up to the bar, called for as stiff a glass of
brandy as any old toper in the land.</p>

<p>"Has Billy Cutts, the detective, been in here
this evening, Joe?" he asked of the white-aproned
bartender, as he set down the brandy glass
which he had drained to the last drop.</p>

<p>"No, he hasn't, Mr. Callister," was the man's
reply. "I haven't seen Billy in more'n a&mdash;&mdash; By
gracious! talk of angels, and they are right on
top of you! Here's Billy Cutts comin' now."</p>

<p>As he spoke a young man, comfortably dressed
in a dark overcoat and ordinary business suit,
entered the saloon.</p>

<p>He was to all appearance not over twenty-two
or twenty-three years of age, but his face bore
indelibly stamped upon it a knowledge of the
crooked ways of the great city not usually looked
for in a man of his years.</p>

<p>He shook hands with the stock operator upon
his entrance, with a familiar, easy-going air, both
withdrawing at once to a table in a remote corner
of the saloon, upon which, by the order of
the elder man, the bartender placed a bottle and
glasses between them.</p>

<p>"Well, Billy, is it all fixed?" said Mr. Callister,
pouring out a stiff glass of liquor for his companion
and another for himself.</p>

<p>"All O. K.," was the reply. "The old man
an' his pals got the plans all right, an' will be on
hand, you can bet. I saw Detective Hook not
an hour ago and gave him the tip. He swallowed
the bait whole, the shallow fool, and now all
that remains is to get the feller to consent, an'
that I consider about fixed."</p>

<p>"How did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, through the help of a couple friends of
his an' tools of mine. They've been workin' on
him for the best part of a week, an' have pretty
well brought him round. I want them in the
thing, too, don't yer see, to give the racket a
natural air."</p>

<p>"Of course neither of them suspect the
truth?"</p>

<p>"What d'ye take me for, boss? I guess I know
what I'm about as a general thing. When I tell
you a thing is fixed, it's fixed; you can bet yer
life on that every time."</p>

<p>"I hope so, and I believe so," replied the
other, in a fierce whisper. "That boy Frank
Mansfield is in my way, Billy. He must and
shall be removed from my path. Your scheme
is a good one, and I believe it will work; if I
read of his arrest in the morning papers you can
count on five thousand dollars any time you
have a mind to call round to my office and get
it."</p>

<p>Mr. Callister arose abruptly as he spoke, and
buttoned up his overcoat as though to depart.</p>

<p>"You'll see me to-morrow mornin', then, fer
sure," replied Cutts, likewise rising. "So you'd
better be ready with the cash."</p>

<p>"I will, Billy, never fear. How's your father,
by the way?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the old man's all right, but confoundedly
nervous till this little spec is over."</p>

<p>"Well, give him my regards when you see
him, and I shall expect to see you with your
work accomplished at my office to-morrow by
noon."</p>

<p>And the respectable Mr. Callister with a face
so smiling that, as the saying goes, butter would
not have melted in his mouth, shook hands with
Detective Cutts and moved off in the direction of
the nearest station on the elevated road.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DYBALL'S CLUB.</p>


<p>Dyball's Club-room was not the most high-toned
of the New York clubs, nor is it frequented
by what are, as a rule, termed the highest of
high-toned men.</p>

<p>Situated on the second floor of a building on
the Bowery, not far from the corner of Canal
street, its nightly patrons were those of a decidedly
low-toned sort.</p>

<p>Small clerks in wholesale stores, small sporting
men, not yet arrived at the dignity of the more
fashionable clubs, and small&mdash;oh, very small&mdash;card-flippers
and poker playing cheats, who
considered the ability to store aces and kings,
<i>ad libitum</i>, in the sleeves of their small-tailed
coats, the very highest touch of art, and who
used their skill, as may be readily believed, to
fleece such of the small clerks who were bold
enough to challenge them to a friendly game.</p>

<p>For card-playing&mdash;and that means plain poker
and nothing else&mdash;was all they did at Dyball's
Club-room, except to consume the vile liquor
and smoke <i>Regalia de Avenue B</i> cigars served
over the bar; but, although limited in variety,
the entertainment furnished made up in quantity
what it otherwise lacked; nor did the votaries
at the Dyball shrine often separate until morning
had well-nigh dawned.</p>

<p>Upon the evening referred to in the last chapter,
at a few minutes after eleven o'clock, just
as the sidewalks along the brilliantly-lighted
Bowery were beginning to whiten with what
promised to be a heavy fall of snow, there entered
Dyball's club room no less celebrated a
person than Mr. Detective Cutts, a young but
already popular special on the force of the New
York police.</p>

<p>He was in citizen's dress, of course&mdash;in fact,
the same in which we have already met him on
this night once before&mdash;and as he pushed his
way among the card tables, a long cigar stuck
in one corner of his mouth, his cane under his
left arm, and his Derby hat set rakishly upon
the side of his head, several of the small clerks
rejoicing in a speaking acquaintance with so
prominent an official, greeted him with an air
of great respect, their less fortunate companions
regarding them with feelings of envy not unmingled
with awe.</p>

<p>But the young detective paid little attention
to any of the players at the card tables.</p>

<p>Pushing his way among them through the
stifling atmosphere, fairly blue with tobacco
smoke, and reeking with the stale odors of whisky
and beer, he approached a small table in a
remote corner of the room, where sat four young
men who, if the chips upon its green baize top
and the anxious faces of the players themselves
could be taken as a guide, were indulging in a
pretty stiff sort of game.</p>

<p>"Frank, I want to see you," he said, quietly,
placing his hand lightly upon the shoulder of the
youngest man of the four.</p>

<p>"All right, Billy, I'll be with you when I finish
this hand."</p>

<p>"I'll wait for you in the wine-room."</p>

<p>"Very good. Two jacks and two queens&mdash;I'll
take that pot, boys. I'll be with you in a second,
Billy&mdash;just one hand more."</p>

<p>It is Frank Mansfield, and no one else, we are
sorry to say, who again deals the cards around,
and with flushed face, being evidently considerably
the worse for drink, a moment later joins
Detective Cutts in the private wine-room, to the
left of Mr. Dyball's bar.</p>

<p>What brings the boy to a place like this?</p>

<p>Disappointment and a fatal love of exciting
pleasures, yielded to too often&mdash;far too often&mdash;in
the past.</p>

<p>Firm in his resolution to reform his ways,
Frank, who loved the daughter of Elijah Callister,
and was devotedly loved by her in return, had,
at her own suggestion, asked of the stock operator
the hand of his daughter in marriage with
the ill success already told.</p>

<p>Now, instead of meeting that refusal like a
man&mdash;instead of returning to the object of his
affections at the house of a mutual friend, who
loved them both, and where they had been in
the habit of meeting at intervals in the past&mdash;Frank
had sought to drown his sorrows by that
fatal method&mdash;recourse to the whisky bottle
and glass.</p>

<p>One drink had been followed by another, the
second by a third, until, reckless of the consequences,
the boy had yielded to a temptation
which he had for days been struggling to resist,
and which&mdash;&mdash; But that brings us back to Detective
Cutts again!</p>

<p>"Well, young fellow, what shall it be?" asked
that individual, touching the little call bell upon
the table by which he had seated himself the moment
Frank appeared.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't care&mdash;whisky, I suppose. What
do you want of me? The same old scheme?"</p>

<p>"Of course. What else should it be?" answered
the detective, calling for the drinks, which
were speedily produced and consumed. "You
can't do better than to join me in that, and I
suppose you have made up your mind to do so,
since you are here by the appointment we made."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. I want to make
money as well as any one, and I'm more than
ever in the mood for it to-night; but I'm afraid
of your scheme, Billy, and I don't deny it. I'm
afraid it'll get me in a hole."</p>

<p>"No, it won't&mdash;nothing of the sort. I don't
want to get you in no hole, nor to land in one
myself. I'm just as honest as any one else, but
I'm bound to look out for No. 1 every time, and
you owe it to yourself to do the same."</p>

<p>"But this letting a man into the bank at night
is something that has a very nasty look."</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't a-goin' to steal nothin', am I?
All I want is to look at a name in a book. Upon
my word, young feller, you're a deal too squeamish.
I can't see where's the possibility of harm
comin' to you from a move like that."</p>

<p>"But it's against all rules. If it were known
that I had shown the signatures of our depositors
to an outsider, I'd lose my place before I
knew where I was."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would. But whose a-goin' to
give you away? To show you that I mean to
be perfectly square with you, I've asked Jim
Morrow and Ed Wilson to meet us down by the
bank and go and see the thing done."</p>

<p>"You have?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They are both good friends of yours,
and in case anything was brought up against
you, you could prove that you did nothing
wrong. Come, now, what do you say? It's getting
late, and if it's to be done at all it must be
done to-night. All I want is to copy the signature
of old Thomas Hendrickson. If you will
help me to do it I'll give you five hundred dollars
as soon as we leave the bank."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand what your man
wants it for. Why can't he get it by some other
means?"</p>

<p>"Because he can't, that's all I know, and I
don't want to know any more. Hendrickson
never leaves his room, and will see no one and
answer no letters; my man has got them deeds
I told you about, and wants to be sure that the
old miser's signature is all O. K.; why, he don't
tell me, and I'm sure I don't care to know, so
long as he is willing to pay for the job he wants
done."</p>

<p>Now this was not the first time Frank Mansfield
had had this proposition made to him by
Detective Cutts, nor the second nor the third.</p>

<p>He had been introduced to this individual
about a month before, by two of his fast companions,
the Jim Morrow and Ed Wilson the detective
had just named, and in their presence
this strange request had been first made, to be
renewed upon several occasions since.</p>

<p>At first the proposal had been rejected outright.</p>

<p>Frank had positively refused to have anything
to do with it at all.</p>

<p>But, upon its repetition, the boy had been
more inclined to lend a willing ear.</p>

<p>He was more inclined than ever to do so upon
this night.</p>

<p>To be sure, he did not more than half believe
the detective's statement as to the reason of his
singular request; but, after all, he was a member
of the police force, an officer of the law, although
little older than Frank himself.</p>

<p>Detectives were obliged, as he knew well
enough, to attain their ends by all sorts of singular
means. Surely, in these days of defaulting
cashiers and pilfering tellers, there could be
no serious harm in letting a police detective
copy a signature from the bank's books.</p>

<p>Nor was the promised reward without its full
weight in the mind of the boy.</p>

<p>"Come to me with proof that you are possessed
of at least ten thousand dollars, and I will
listen to you, and not before," the father of the
girl he so devotedly loved had said.</p>

<p>Money makes money.</p>

<p>With five hundred dollars he would at least obtain
a start.</p>

<p>Visions of successful speculations in the institutions
known as "bucket shops," which cluster
around the Stock Exchange, floated through
his brain.</p>

<p>If he had luck, as many of his acquaintances
had had before him, his five hundred might be
doubled in no time at all, and the thousand thus
increased to ten in a comparative short space of
time.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Cutts, I'll do it!" he exclaimed at last;
"but, mind, if you go back on me, I can make it
as hot for you at police headquarters as you can
for me at the bank. I'll show you the signature-book
of the Webster Bank, and let you trace old
Hendrickson's autograph from it&mdash;but don't expect
me to do anything else."</p>

<p>"I shan't, my boy, for that's all I want," replied
the detective, with an air of triumph.
"Now let's have another drink."</p>

<p>There were two doors connecting with the private
wine room of Dyball's club.</p>

<p>One opened into the main or card room, and
the other out into the hallway, from which descended
the stairs leading to the street.</p>

<p>Had Detective Cutts been a little older in the
business, and a little more observing withal, he
might have noticed that during all his conversation
with Frank Mansfield this hall door stood
open on the crack.</p>

<p>No sooner had the young men left Dyball's by
the regular entrance, and gaining the stairs, descended
to the street, than from the floor of the
hall close to the wine room there arose the form
of a woman.</p>

<p>She was of somewhat above the ordinary
stature, but of withered features and attenuated
form, while her long gray hair, hanging in a
tangled mass down her neck and shoulders, and
a pair of wild, restless eyes ever moving in their
shrunken sockets, lent to her whole appearance
an air of hopeless misery painful to behold.</p>

<p>Her dress neat, but shabby and worn; a faded
shawl and a cheap woolen hood being the only
outer wraps she wore.</p>

<p>And this strange creature crept after the two
young men in the darkness and storm, dogging
their steps as they moved down the Bowery towards
Chatham Square never taking her restless
eyes from their moving figures for so much
as a moment of time.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">AN UNHEEDED WARNING&mdash;FRANK MANSFIELD
FINDS HIMSELF IN A BAD FIX.</p>


<p>The storm had now greatly increased, and the
whitened flakes were rapidly covering sidewalk
and street, as well as the forms of such belated
pedestrians as hurried past, while the glass in
the lighted store fronts glistened with frost like
so many diamonds in the light of the flickering
street lamps scattered here and there.</p>

<p>Now, the Webster National Bank, as is well
known to every one, is located on the corner of
Rector street and Broadway, directly opposite
the high wall, ever rising as the street descends,
upon the top of which lies the ancient burial
ground surrounding Trinity Church.</p>

<p>Bustling with life and activity during the business
hours of the day, at night no more lonely
spot can be found in all New York than this.</p>

<p>Standing a little back from the street rises the
mighty spire of this, New York's most famous
house of worship, surrounded on three sides by
the crumbling head-stones of a century ago, and
marking the last resting-place of many a famous
citizen of the days gone by.</p>

<p>Rising above these stones, the many dingy
tombs scattered among them, clusters of noble
trees raise their spreading branches toward the
sky above, overshadowing this time-honored
burial place of the dead.</p>

<p>Brick and mortar everywhere, gigantic structures
upon every hand, the old Trinity church-yard
has remained untouched by the hand of
Time&mdash;remained the one green spot in lower
New York, even as it was in the days when the
great city was young.</p>

<p>It was upon this sight that Frank Mansfield
daily looked forth, for his desk in the bank commanded
a full view of the church-yard from the
Rector street side.</p>

<p>It was by the side of the wall that, with his
companion, he now stands, contemplating an
act, which, if not criminal, is a breach of the implicit
trust placed in him by the officers of the
Webster National Bank, at least.</p>

<p>And now the old church-yard is robed in
white, the snow flakes bearing downward the
branches of the spreading trees, covering the
tombs and graves of the dead&mdash;we doubt very
much if the souls of many who lie beneath are
as white as the ground above their moldering
bones.</p>

<p>Detective Cutts turned the corner of Rector
street, and moved silently along the church-yard
wall.</p>

<p>It was now twelve o'clock and after&mdash;in fact,
the bell of Old Trinity had rung out the midnight
hour before they passed the corner of Fulton
street and Broadway.</p>

<p>The storm had increased as the night advanced,
Broadway was deserted, and not a soul could be
seen moving on Rector street from end to end.</p>

<p>For the evil-doer no better night could be found
than this&mdash;even the policemen had sought shelter
in friendly doorways from the pitiless storm.</p>

<p>"By George! but this is a nasty night!" said
the detective, in a low whisper, coming to a halt
beneath the shadow of the wall. "Now, where
in thunder are those fellows, I'd like to know?
They promised to be on the corner at midnight
and wait until we came."</p>

<p>"Well, we can do without them," said Frank,
uneasily, beginning already to repent of the step
he had taken.</p>

<p>"For my part, I can't see what we want with
them, anyhow. The thing don't amount to anything,
after all."</p>

<p>The liquor of which he had partaken so freely
was beginning to tell on him.</p>

<p>He mistrusted his companion, he mistrusted
himself; he was anxious to do what he had undertaken
and begun.</p>

<p>After all, it was but a little thing, and with
the money he could do so much.</p>

<p>He had been trying to persuade himself, but
with ill success, during the walk down-town,
that it amounted to just nothing, after all.</p>

<p>"Why, I only want them with us for your
own protection, my dear boy," replied Cutts.
"I'm as square as a die myself, and I want you
to see that everything I do is entirely open and
above the board.</p>

<p>"By the way, you've got a key to the side
door of the bank, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the cashier and myself carry that."</p>

<p>"And you tell me there's no watchman in
the bank?"</p>

<p>"No; otherwise I should not be here, of
course. This corner is so prominent that they
never thought it worth their while to keep one
employed. It's lucky for you, Cutts, that they
think as they do."</p>

<p>"I should say so," replied the detective,
with a slightly marked emphasis. "And that
being the case, we can slip in that side door and
through the hall as easily as you please."</p>

<p>Now, there are two entrances to the Webster
National Bank.</p>

<p>One from Broadway and one from Rector
street.</p>

<p>It was to the latter that Detective Cutts referred.</p>

<p>"I say, Frank," said that individual, in a
whisper, "we may be observed if we stand
waiting here. I move we jump over the church-yard
fence and wait on the inside until Jim
and Ed show up."</p>

<p>Careless now of what he did, and too much
muddled in his brain through the fumes of the
liquor to give the matter very much thought,
Frank followed Cutts as he lightly leaped upon
the low wall and vaulted the fence, landing inside
among the snow-covered stones.</p>

<p>At the same instant from among the trees
in the shadow of the great church beyond a low
whistle was heard, which was presently followed
by the appearance of two dark forms moving
cautiously toward the spot where they stood.</p>

<p>"Hello, is that you, Billy?"</p>

<p>The voice came from the advancing figures,
now emerging from the trees.</p>

<p>"Yes," called Cutts, in a whisper. "Is that
you, Ed&mdash;you and Jim?"</p>

<p>How came these two in the Trinity church-yard
at this hour of the night?</p>

<p>The strangeness of the thing struck the boy at
once, as he stood leaning against the rail.</p>

<p>"What the mischief are you fellows doing
there?" he exclaimed, peering forward into the
darkness. "Cutts, what does this thing mean?"</p>

<p>"It means villainy, it means wickedness!"
cried a feeble voice from the sidewalk below.
"It means ruin to you, my son, if you persist in
what you are about to do."</p>

<p>There, kneeling upon the snow-covered pavement
beneath the wall, Frank, turning suddenly
and pressing his face against the iron palings,
perceived a strange and weird form.</p>

<p>It was a woman, old, faded and gray, who,
with upturned features and hands clasped above
her head now met his astonished gaze.</p>

<p>It was the singular creature who had followed
him from the gambling hall.</p>

<p>Not for one moment had the boy been lost from
her view.</p>

<p>"Pause, my son!" she exclaimed, raising her
clasped hands aloft with a supplicating air, as
she knelt before him in the pure white snow.
"Remember your dead father&mdash;I ask you not to
remember me&mdash;pause before it is too late."</p>

<p>"Hello!" cried Cutts, placing his hand on
Frank's shoulder as he spoke, "who the mischief
have we here?"</p>

<p>As though stung by an adder, the boy shrank
back from that aged form.</p>

<p>"Mother!" he cried, in husky tones, "for God's
sake, what brings you here? Have they let you
escape again?"</p>

<p>"Escape!" said the woman, in feeble tones.
"Can doors hold a mother when danger besets
her son? No, no, bolts and bars cannot keep
me in. Locks amount to nothing for me. I
roam the streets by night and by day, and I
watch over you, my son."</p>

<p>"She is mad, Cutts!" cried the boy angrily;
"mad for years, and has escaped from those by
whom she was confined. Follow me, and let's
be done with this thing at once. With her on
my hands I need the money more than ever
now."</p>

<p>He leaped the fence railing as he spoke with
the lightness of a cat, landing by the woman's
side.</p>

<p>Cutts instantly followed him, as did the two
young men, who had during this strange scene
come to a halt a little in the rear of the spot
where Frank and the detective had stood.</p>

<p>"No, no, you shall not go! You shall not rob
the bank!" shrieked the woman, seizing Frank
by the skirts of his coat. "Don't listen to these
wicked men, my son; they only seek your
harm!"</p>

<p>"Confound the old hag!" muttered the detective,
angrily. "What are we going to do? If
we don't stop her mouth she will ruin all."</p>

<p>"Hold her where she is and stop her mouth;
but gently, boys," said Frank, in a hoarse voice.
"Cutts, you follow me and the thing is done.
I've gone too far to back out now. I want
your pay, and as I am wronging no one, have it
I must and will."</p>

<p>He sprang across the street as he spoke, followed
by the young detective, while the woman,
feebly struggling in the arms of the two young
fellows, still knelt moaning beneath the church
yard wall.</p>

<p>"I'll have to take care of her, Cutts," said
Frank, producing a key and fitting it into the
lock of the door of the bank. "She's hopelessly
crazy, poor thing, and God only knows by what
strange chance she came to be here to-night."</p>

<p>He turned the key in the lock as he spoke and
threw open the door leading into a dark hallway
in the great building on the corner of Rector
street and Broadway, in the rear of the offices
occupied by the Webster National Bank.</p>

<p>"Follow me," he added, entering the passage
as he spoke, "and shut the door behind you&mdash;it
won't take a moment, and the thing is done."</p>

<p>He moved through the passage and opened an
inner door, supposing the detective to be close
behind.</p>

<p>Great heavens! What sight was this?</p>

<p>There, before his astonished gaze in the dim
light of the gas, kept burning through the entire
night in this, as in other banks, lay the great
doors of the money vault blown out of all shape,
disclosing the vault within.</p>

<p>A burglar's jimmy, a crowbar, and a powder-can
lay mingled with a pile of books and papers&mdash;the
contents of the rifled vault&mdash;upon the
floor.</p>

<p>"Cutts, Cutts! For Heaven's sake look here!"</p>

<p>Frank Mansfield sprang out into the dark hall,
calling the detective's name.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>The outer door stood open, the dark outlines
of Trinity Church appeared beyond, but Detective
Cutts was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>With one bound Frank Mansfield leaped toward
that open door.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried a stern voice. "Young man,
what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>And the form of a large and powerful man
was interposed before him, who seized the boy
by the arm.</p>

<p>"This way, men!" he cried, as three policemen
came running down Rector street from
Broadway. "Here's one of the rascals now.
We are here just in the nick of time!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE BENEATH THE
CHURCH-YARD WALL.</p>


<p>"Come, speak up! Are you dumb? What
are you doing at the door of the Webster Bank
at this hour of the night?"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Caleb Hook, the famous New York
detective, who spoke, as he seized Frank Mansfield
by the coat-collar and jerked him violently
into the dark hallway which formed the rear entrance
to the bank.</p>

<p>At the same instant the forms of the three policemen
were to be seen filling the open door.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the detective threw the full
glare of a dark lantern upon the pale and frightened
countenance of the boy who stood trembling
in his grasp.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;work in the bank," he stammered,
brokenly. "I wanted&mdash;&mdash; I am the assistant
cashier. I came here with my friend, Detective
Cutts, to try the door and see that all was right."</p>

<p>It was a bold stroke, but a useless one.</p>

<p>Detective Hook laughed in his face.</p>

<p>"Well, and where is Cutts?" he asked, sneeringly.</p>

<p>"He was here a moment ago, just outside the
door. I went into the bank and found that the
vault had been blown open, and turned to call
him in as you seized me on the steps."</p>

<p>"I don't see him anywhere around," said the
detective, coolly, at the same time pulling Frank
toward the door, and looking quickly up and
down Rector street.</p>

<p>It was deserted.</p>

<p>Cutts, the strange woman, and the two young
fellows who held her down had alike disappeared.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be seen save the dark
outlines of Trinity Church, the old burial ground
about it, and the white flakes of the ever falling
snow.</p>

<p>And the heart of Frank Mansfield sank within
him as the full meaning of his perilous position
burst upon his bewildered brain.</p>

<p>The bank robbed&mdash;Cutts and his companions
gone.</p>

<p>Who would believe his story, now that he had
been caught almost in front of the rifled vault?</p>

<p>"Now look here, young fellow," said the detective,
"you might just as well own up and
tell the truth. Where are your pals? Who are
you? What's your name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Frank Mansfield. I'm assistant
cashier of the bank."</p>

<p>There was nothing to be gained by attempting
to conceal his identity; Frank saw that at a
glance.</p>

<p>"I thought as much," replied the detective
grimly, "and I'm a little behind time, I see.
But you don't answer my other question. Where
are your pals?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Spread yourself, you Jones and Brady," exclaimed
the detective, turning suddenly upon the
officers. "Examine every doorway, one of you,
the other make for the church-yard wall.
Schneider, you come with me. We'll soon see
what's been going on in here. This comes from
the folly of the chief in keeping me so long engaged.
I might have been here an hour ago at
the very least."</p>

<p>He turned quickly upon the boy as he spoke,
and without a word of warning snapped a pair
of handcuffs about his wrists.</p>

<p>"Move on ahead there," he exclaimed, pushing
Frank before him into the hall. "You say
this bank has been robbed. I believe you. Show
me what you have done."</p>

<p>The vault door, wrenched out of all shape and
hanging by one hinge, the burglar's tools, the
books and papers scattered upon the floor around,
were quite answer enough without a word from
the wretched Frank, who stood trembling by his
side.</p>

<p>The detective surveyed the scene grimly.</p>

<p>"I was born a day too late, it seems," was all
he said.</p>

<p>Then, turning toward his youthful prisoner, he
gazed intently upon his face.</p>

<p>"You and your friends have made a clean job
of it here, young man," he said, at length.</p>

<p>Frank stared at him dumbly.</p>

<p>Could he hope to win the hand of Edna Callister
after such a fatal slip as this?</p>

<p>What was he to do?</p>

<p>What should he say?</p>

<p>Ah, if he had but heeded the warning voice of
that mother who had knelt before him in the
snow!</p>

<p>But no! He had for the meanest of motives,
money, been willing to violate the confidence and
trust reposed in him by the officers of the bank,
and this was his reward.</p>

<p>Not without his fair share of natural shrewdness,
Frank at once perceived that his only hope
lay in silence and a strict adhesion to the story
he had told, which to a certain extent was true.</p>

<p>He had come to the bank with Cutts&mdash;as for
his reason for so doing, he determined to keep
that to himself, for the present, at least.</p>

<p>"Well," said the detective, "why don't you
speak?"</p>

<p>"Because I've nothing to say. I've told you
all I know."</p>

<p>"Do you persist in the statement that you
came here with Mr. Cutts?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"I've already told you that."</p>

<p>"To see that all was right about the bank?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is that your business?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly. We had been spending
the evening together, and happened to be passing,
and I thought I would try the door."</p>

<p>"Mistake added to wrong doing."</p>

<p>Lies never yet availed any man in an emergency.</p>

<p>Better by far would it have been for the boy if
he had confessed his fault and told the simple
truth.</p>

<p>"And upon entering you found things as we
see them now?" continued the detective, with an
incredulous air.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you carry a key to those doors?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Both the cashier and myself have
keys."</p>

<p>"Suppose you give them to me."</p>

<p>Frank motioned toward his pocket, into which
Detective Hook now thrust his hand, drawing
forth the keys, and embracing the opportunity
to search the boy thoroughly at the same time,
but finding, as a matter of course, nothing to
further indicate any connection with the affair.</p>

<p>He examined the keys attentively, and turning,
tried them in the lock of the door.</p>

<p>One of them fitted perfectly.</p>

<p>The detective appeared surprised.</p>

<p>"You told the truth, then, my boy," he said,
regarding the handsome face of the youth before
him meditatively as he spoke. "I don't know
what to make of this. Either you are other than
what you seem to be, or I've been most outrageously
sold."</p>

<p>"I assure you, sir," exclaimed Frank, plucking
up a spirit, "that I am just what I tell you,
as any officer of the bank can testify, if you will
take the trouble to ask. The janitor of this
building knows me. Were it only daylight, I
could prove my identity in a dozen ways.
What has become of Cutts and those who were
with him, I am sure is more than I can tell, but
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! Then there were others here besides
Cutts and yourself?"</p>

<p>A deep flush overspread the countenance of
the boy.</p>

<p>Here was a fatal slip.</p>

<p>Until now he had relied upon Cutts' desire to
shield himself to be cautious in what he might
say, but as for Ed Wilson and Jim Morrow, who
were nothing more or less than two very fast
young clerks in a neighboring steamship office,
he saw instinctively that he could hope to exercise
no control whatever with them.</p>

<p>But there was no use in trying to conceal anything
from the keen eyes of the detective, now
fixed upon him as though seeking to read his inmost
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Yes, there were two other fellows with us,"
he answered, with evident reluctance.</p>

<p>"Who were they?"</p>

<p>"Acquaintances of mine."</p>

<p>"And their names?"</p>

<p>"Wilson and Morrow."</p>

<p>"Hem! And they, likewise, seem to have disappeared,
most unluckily for you."</p>

<p>"So it seems," said Frank, gloomily. "I'm
sure I don't understand it any more than you."</p>

<p>"We'll understand it better by and by," replied
the detective, quietly. "Meanwhile, think
the matter over, if you will allow me to offer my
advice, and make up your mind to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth. You'll
find it will pay you better in the end."</p>

<p>"Schneider," he added, turning abruptly to
the policeman who had been a silent witness to
the scene, "take this young man to the New
Church street station, and let him be held until
I come."</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Hook," replied the officer.</p>

<p>Without another word he took Frank by the
arm and led him through the hall and out into
the street.</p>

<p>The snow was still falling, sidewalk and roofs,
church-yard and wall, everything within range
of the eye, was clothed in a mantle of white.</p>

<p>"Now, den, de nex' question is how ve not our
necks already preak," muttered the officer, with
a strong German accent, as he moved heavily
down the sloping sidewalk toward New Church
street, which skirts the rear of the burial ground
at the bottom of the hill.</p>

<p>For he was a clumsy man, and had evidently
no wish to measure the length of his Teutonic
form upon the slippery walk beneath his feet.</p>

<p>"Keep close beside me, young feller," he added,
releasing his hold upon Frank's arm, the better
to steady himself by aid of the hand-rail separating
the sidewalk from the sunken areas before
the basement shops with which this block on
Rector street is lined. "You notings can do mit
tem pracelets on your hands, so dere's no use in
trying to run."</p>

<p>"I'm not running to-night," replied Frank,
shortly. "Lead on, I shall follow; you need
have no fear."</p>

<p>"Nein, you go ahead, den I keeps you in
sight," said the policeman, pushing the boy
before him. "You gets not pehind me ef I
knows vat I do."</p>

<p>Frank made no reply, but plowed his way on
through the snow, Officer Schneider following
close in his rear.</p>

<p>At a word from that individual, upon reaching
New Church street, he turned to the right and
moved slowly along the wall of Trinity church-yard,
here rising high above their heads.</p>

<p>To the left rose the structure of the elevated
railroad, to the right the wall itself, the iron
railing still surmounting it, from which hung,
depending, clusters of the snow-covered vines.</p>

<p>Not a soul was to be seen moving about them.</p>

<p>The street was deserted for as great a distance
as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>They had hardly proceeded half the length of
the wall, when, proceeding apparently from the
clustered vines above them, a shrill, piping
sound was heard.</p>

<p>It was precisely such a sound as bats are
sometimes heard to make just at nightfall as
they go whizzing through the air.</p>

<p>"Vat in tonder ish dat?" exclaimed Officer
Schneider, coming to a sudden halt, and looking
up into the air.</p>

<p>Again the strange sound broke upon the stillness
of the night a little ahead of them through
the thick mass of falling snow.</p>

<p>Both Frank and the policeman had now checked
their steps close to the church-yard wall.</p>

<p>At the recurrence of the sound, forgetting for
the instant that he had a prisoner on his hands,
Officer Schneider moved a few steps in advance
of the boy, and raising his head, tried to peer in
among the clustered vines, all laden with snow,
which overhung the iron fence upon the top of
the wall, leaving the boy standing behind.</p>

<p>"I can't see notings," he muttered, "but dere's
something crooked going on up dere. Dis is not
de first time nor de second I hear dot sound.
Who goes up mit dem valls on top, I'd schust
like to know?"</p>

<p>Now this was a little private mystery of the
officer's own, this self-same bat-like sound.</p>

<p>Several times previous to the present occasion
had he heard it, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>And what ails Officer Schneider now?</p>

<p>Enough to make him stare as he does, and
shower all the German imprecations known to
his vocabulary upon the air around.</p>

<p>For the handcuffed prisoner, whom he supposed
to be standing so close to him that it was
only necessary to reach out and touch him, had
during that one moment in which he had raised
his head to the top of the wall above him, from
which proceeded the bat-like sound, most mysteriously
vanished.</p>

<p>There were his footprints on the snow-covered
walk, nor was there other prints anywhere to be
seen upon the smooth surface of the street, save
those made by the boy and himself, and pointing
up&mdash;not down the street.</p>

<p>And this was all.</p>

<p>His handcuffed prisoner, who could not by any
possibility have advanced a dozen steps through
the snow in the brief space of time during which
the policeman's attention had been withdrawn,
had strangely, marvelously disappeared.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BATS IN THE WALL.</p>


<p>Left to himself within the banking-room,
Detective Hook, with the closest scrutiny, began
a systematic examination of the rifled vault and
its surroundings.</p>

<p>There was no evidence that the bank had been
entered other than by the rear doors from the
Rector street side.</p>

<p>And these doors, strange to relate, were unprotected,
save by ordinary spring locks.</p>

<p>Evidently the officers of the Webster Bank
had relied upon the solidity of their vault doors
for protection, and upon the fact that with plate
glass windows upon two sides, facing Rector
street and Broadway, the policeman on the beat
could see the entire front of the vault as plainly
as though it had been standing in the street itself,
by the light of the gas-burner, kept burning
the entire night directly in front of the
combination lock.</p>

<p>And, after all, no better protection could be
devised than this, providing always, the policeman
of the beat is true to his trust.</p>

<p>And yet the deed had been done, and, stranger
still the officer in whose charge this portion
of Broadway lay had put in no appearance yet.</p>

<p>Crowbar and jimmy, powder-can and fuse,
and the shattered door itself, told with startling
plainness the methods by which the bank-robbers
had attained their end.</p>

<p>Detective Hook examined each point with
close attention.</p>

<p>Nothing of value remained in the vault.</p>

<p>It might have contained millions&mdash;it might
have contained cents&mdash;the bank officers alone
could tell.</p>

<p>"There is something altogether out of the
usual order in this affair," he muttered to himself,
as he stood musing before the rifled vault.</p>

<p>"The strange hints received by me from Cutts
have proved both true and false. Instead of this
clerk and a gang of desperate burglars, I find the
vault already robbed and this young man with
his strange story, involving Cutts himself, standing
here alone.</p>

<p>"I don't like the look of it. I believe this boy
is as innocent as I am, Caleb Hook; there is
something else at the bottom of all this. If I
don't greatly mistake&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hello! Well, what have you discovered?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Policeman Jones, now appearing
at the door. "There's not a soul anywhere
about, except an old crazy woman walking
up and down before Trinity Church, muttering
to herself. I questioned her closely, but she
knows nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Did you see anything of Officer Flaherty,
who ought to be on this beat?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing, and I've searched for him everywhere,
too."</p>

<p>"I'll see that he is provided for, the careless
rascal," muttered the detective, "and you,
Brady"&mdash;addressing the second policeman who
had also appeared&mdash;"what luck in the church-yard?
Any tracks in the snow?"</p>

<p>"The tracks of two men, Mr. Hook, but they
are pointing this way. Just over the fence are
others, too. I should say several persons had
been tramping around there."</p>

<p>"Remain here and guard what is left," said
the detective, briefly. "I'll examine into this
for myself."</p>

<p>He hastily passed to the street, leaving the
two policemen in charge.</p>

<p>"Now for the Trinity church-yard," he muttered,
as he sprang toward the low wall at the point
before which the strange woman had kneeled but
a few moments before. "I've got a genuine
mystery on my hands at last, I fancy, and that's
what I've been sighing for these last three
months&mdash;&mdash; Ha, Schneider, where's your prisoner?
Surely you are not back from the station
as soon as this?"</p>

<p>The stout German policeman, panting for a
breath, stood trembling by his side.</p>

<p>"Dunder und blitzen! now mebbe you kills me,
Mr. Hook. I swear it vos not my fault."</p>

<p>"Not your fault! Have you lost your prisoner&mdash;but
that is impossible! Speak, you Dutch
scoundrel! Where is the boy I gave into your
charge?"</p>

<p>"Gone, Mr. Hook! Disappeared unter mein
very nose. I take not mein eyes from him, und
I looks for him und he ish not dere. I tink dere's
some devil vork mit dis, by shiminy, I do!"</p>

<p>A moment later, and Detective Hook, with the
frightened German by his side, stood beneath
the high wall skirting Trinity church-yard on the
New Church street side, at the spot where Frank
Mansfield had so strangely disappeared.</p>

<p>Twice over had the wretched Schneider told
his tale, without rendering matters in the least
more clear.</p>

<p>If he told the truth&mdash;and he related the facts
so circumstantially that there could be no doubt
of that&mdash;there was absolutely no explanation to
be had.</p>

<p>There was the dead wall upon one side broken
only by the iron doors, leading to the vaults beneath
the bank, which had not been opened,
perhaps in a century, filled with the moldering
bones of the long-forgotten dead, and the structure
of the elevated railroad upon the other, with
the dark outlines of the building upon the opposite
side of the street rising just beyond.</p>

<p>That the boy could have crossed the street was
a simple impossibility.</p>

<p>Not a trace of human foot was visible in the
freshly fallen snow.</p>

<p>Upon the sidewalk beneath the wall the detective
had no difficulty in tracing his footsteps.</p>

<p>But this only served to double the mystery.</p>

<p>They all pointed one way&mdash;in the direction of
the station toward which they had been going,
and at the precise point where the boy had halted
when the attention of his conductor had been
attracted by the bat-like cry from the wall above
they ceased to appear at all.</p>

<p>It was impossible that the vanished prisoner
could have advanced or retreated, crossed the
street&mdash;moved up or down.</p>

<p>Deeply puzzled, the detective hurried to Rector
street again, and leaped the iron fence at the
first available point, landing among the stones
of the grave-yard beyond.</p>

<p>Nor did he leave it until an hour had passed,
and but little the wiser then.</p>

<p>The tracks of two men crossing toward the
Rector street side of the grave-yard from a point
overlooking the place where Frank had disappeared
were found and carefully measured.</p>

<p>At this point, also, the snow was found to be
much disturbed, both on the ground itself and
upon the vines overhanging the wall.</p>

<p>To all appearance, a number of persons had
been moving about here, but their foot-prints
seemed to lead nowhere, extending simply up
and down the wall.</p>

<p>What did it mean?</p>

<p>Detective Hook had been called upon to solve
many mysteries in his time, but never before had
he encountered one so deep as this.</p>

<p>He was baffled; he could not deny it.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the crestfallen Schneider, he
repaired to the station at last, and reported the
occurrences of the night.</p>

<p>In a short space of time every newspaper in
the city was preparing for their morning issues
an account of the bold robbery of the Webster
National Bank.</p>

<p>The great clock in Trinity steeple had rang out
the hour of four, when Detective Hook, still hovering
about the scene of his late defeat, turned,
for the twentieth time that night, the corner of
Rector street and Broadway.</p>

<p>As he did so there brushed past him the figure
of a woman, plainly but neatly dressed, with
gray hair hanging down from beneath her worsted
hood, and wild, roving eyes, moving restlessly
from one object to another as she walked
along.</p>

<p>"Bats in the wall! Bats in the wall!" she
muttered, as she passed. "Blessed be the bats
in the wall for what they have done for my erring
boy this night!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CATHERINE MARKET.</p>


<p>Of all the quaint old landmarks still standing
in the city of New York that serve to remind the
more ancient of its inhabitants of the days when
they were young, surely none so quaint and curious
as the old Catherine Market and its surroundings
can be said anywhere to exist.</p>

<p>It stood there at the foot of the street whose
name it bears when the writer was a boy&mdash;and
many long years before&mdash;and will, no doubt,
stand there long after he is dead and gone, a
low, narrow shed of rotten wood, in color a
dingy brown, with three half-round windows on
the ferry side&mdash;we mean the ones over the oyster
booth, where they used to give a round dozen
saddle-rocks to every stew, and over the coffee
and cake saloon, where the butter-cakes were
always fresh on the pan&mdash;looking like the eyes
of some great monster standing majestically
alone in the center of the little square, calmly
watching the crowds that pour out of the ferry-gates
as the sun rises up, and pour in again as it
goes down.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing stylish about the Catherine
Market, nothing in any way smacking of
"tone."</p>

<p>It is not one-third the size of the Washington
Market, nor does it profess to have that far-famed
celebrity for succulent meats, fat turtle,
fish, oysters and clams to which Fulton Market
lays claim.</p>

<p>But it does a driving, thriving business of its
own, just the same, does the Catherine Market&mdash;make
no mistake about that!</p>

<p>For here come to purchase their daily supplies
the denizens of Water, Cherry and Oliver streets,
of Madison, Monroe and Hamilton streets, to say
nothing of East Broadway, equal in number,
when taken all in all, to the population of a
good-sized city in themselves.</p>

<p>If one wants to see the Catherine Market in
the full tide of its bustling trade, Sunday morning
is the time to come&mdash;when the fish peddlers
cluster outside its walls, between the hours of
four and five.</p>

<p>They spread themselves up South street; they
stand beside their pails, tubs and baskets on the
sidewalk facing the old tumble-down rookeries
on the side of Catherine street to the right of the
market itself, and before the second hand clothing
stores on the left.</p>

<p>Blue-fish, white-fish, weak-fish, porgies, twisting
eels, and soft clams strung on strings, lobsters
alive and lobsters boiled, soft-shell crabs,
packed in moss-lined boxes, hard-shell crabs, not
packed at all&mdash;all are spread about outside of
this singular building on the sidewalk in the
gutter&mdash;yes, even in the very street itself, while
the bawling of the fishermen as they cry the merits
of their wares, the cackle of housewives,
moving about here and there with giant market
baskets on their arms, are all mingled in one
unearthly clatter and din.</p>

<p>Nor is this all.</p>

<p>Other branches of trade must needs elbow
their way into this busy spot as well, all carried
on from baskets in the open streets, be it plainly
understood, whose owners sit or stand beside
them on the pavement as best they can.</p>

<p>But waste no time in seeking what is new.</p>

<p>This is most emphatically the bartering-place
of the worn and old.</p>

<p>Second-hand coats, trousers, hats and shoes.
Damaged crockery, rusty cutlery, half-worn articles
of ladies' apparel, whose uses we would,
of course, not even dare to name. Lace curtains,
kitchen pots and pans, cheap chromos,
candlesticks and beads, all are represented here,
while small peddlers, whose stock in trade is
carried in their hands, move here and there in
the crowd, adding, with their various cries, to
the strangeness of the scene.</p>

<p>We left Detective Hook by the church-yard
wall at the moment of his encounter with the
woman who with strange mutterings hurried
past.</p>

<p>We find him at the early hour of half-past
four moving down Catherine street in the direction
of the singular scene we have just described.</p>

<p>And just before him is the woman, still treading
wearily along the snow-covered sidewalk,
her wild eyes ever roving here and there, now to
the right and now to the left, never resting for
even one moment of time.</p>

<p>The storm has ceased at last. The clouds have
rolled away to the eastward; the stars shine
brightly in the cold, wintry sky.</p>

<p>And the busy market is teeming with activity
and life while the remainder of the great city is
still locked in slumber and repose.</p>

<p>Who is this strange creature with her singular
mutterings concerning "bats in the wall?"</p>

<p>It is just this that the detective sought to
learn; and in the endeavor to learn it had not
suffered the woman to pass from his observation
from the moment of their first encounter until
now.</p>

<p>At the instant of their meeting he had stopped
her and questioned her sharply.</p>

<p>That she was beyond all question insane was
perfectly clear.</p>

<p>Her remarks were most incoherent, and yet
they bore direct reference to the subject weighing
most heavily upon the mind of Detective
Hook: the robbery of the Webster Bank.</p>

<p>"He robbed the bank! He robbed the bank!
I warned him, but he would not heed."</p>

<p>This was her sole answer to the questions the
detective had pressed upon her, mingled with
muttered words of thankfulness to the "bats in
the wall."</p>

<p>Now nine men out of ten, under similar circumstances,
would have arrested this woman at
once.</p>

<p>Detective Hook was of a different sort.</p>

<p>Let him arrest this woman mad beyond a
doubt&mdash;and, save for such vague information as
could be drawn from her muttered ravings, her
usefulness would at once be destroyed.</p>

<p>Follow her, and there was no telling where she
might lead him&mdash;possibly to the abode of the
bank-robbers themselves.</p>

<p>That she had seen those who blew open the
vault, either enter or leave the bank, from her
rambling words the detective became firmly convinced;
so he let her go, and, dropping all else,
followed her through the streets on that Sabbath
morning. If nothing came of it he could at least
arrest her whenever he pleased.</p>

<p>And a long road she had led him, until at the
Catherine Market we find them now, with Caleb
Hook seriously debating in his mind whether it
would not be best to take her in charge at once
and end this so far useless chase.</p>

<p>Crossing Cherry street, the woman pushed her
way among the old clothes dealers and second-hand
venders whose baskets were crowded together
in the snow-covered street upon this side,
and passing along the wall of the market itself,
paused among the fish-mongers who cluster opposite
the ferry gate.</p>

<p>"Fresh fish this morning, ma'am?" cried a
runty vender, well wrapped up in a coat that
looked as though it might have done service in
the days of Noah's flood. "Blue-fish, weak-fish,
flounders, sea-bass, eels. Any kind you want
you'll find right here!"</p>

<p>But the woman did not heed him.</p>

<p>Moving slowly on among the baskets, she
passed the front of the market and crossed the
street to the other side.</p>

<p>There she turned, and proceeding perhaps half
way up the block, stopped before the window of
a low rum-shop, and, raising her hand to her
forehead, stood peering in behind the corner of
the battered curtain which shielded its lighted interior
from the gaze of an over-inquisitive outer
world.</p>

<p>"At last she stops," muttered the detective to
himself, as he took his station by the side of the
old hotel on the corner of Catherine street and
South, watching to see what her next move would
be. "Now, whose place is that, I wonder, and
what does she expect to see?"</p>

<p>He glanced at the sign above the door of the
groggery.</p>

<p>"The Donegal Shades, by P. Slattery," was
the way it read.</p>

<p>It was evidently a saloon for the accommodation
of the marketmen, open at this early hour
on Sunday morning in defiance of the law.</p>

<p>As he did so his attention was attracted by two
figures advancing toward the saloon from the
street above.</p>

<p>One was a youth of twenty or twenty-one, the
other a boy, his junior, perhaps, by a year or
two.</p>

<p>Both were roughly dressed in cheap, worn
clothes, the younger of the pair carrying a bundle
of newspapers under his arm.</p>

<p>At the same instant the woman, having seemingly
satisfied her curiosity, opened the door and
entered the saloon.</p>

<p>"Now, then," muttered the detective, "this
has gone as far as it must. Unless I greatly
mistake, there's business inside there for me."</p>

<p>He moved rapidly forward as he spoke toward
the door of P. Slattery's Shades.</p>

<p>At the same moment the two boys came to a
halt beneath a street lamp before the saloon, toward
which the younger of the pair pointed with
his raised right hand, addressing his companion
in hurried words, spoken in too low a tone for
the detective to hear.</p>

<p>As he did so, in the light of the lamp above
their heads Detective Hook, glancing carelessly
at them, obtained a good view of the features of
both.</p>

<p>With a smothered exclamation of surprise he
came to a sudden halt&mdash;stood staring for an instant
only at the features of the elder boy.</p>

<p>It was Frank Mansfield who stood before him&mdash;the
youthful clerk of the Webster Bank, who
had so strangely vanished from beside the Trinity
church-yard wall.</p>

<p>Fatal pause!</p>

<p>In that instant of hesitation the eyes of the
boy met his own.</p>

<p>Seizing his companion by the arm, he turned
and sped along the icy walk like a deer.</p>

<p>"Stop there!" cried Hook, springing forward
with a bound. "Halt! you young rascal!" and
he reached forth his hand to catch the flying boy
by the tails of his coat, now almost within his
grasp.</p>

<p>But a sudden obstacle intervened.</p>

<p>At this identical moment a roughly dressed individual
emerged hastily from the Donegal
Shades, carrying upon his arm a large open basket
loaded with fish, thrusting himself inadvertently
directly in the detective's path.</p>

<p>It all happened in an instant, and indeed, it is
difficult to explain how it happened at all.</p>

<p>But the foot of the detective slipping beneath
him, he came in sudden and violent contact with
the basket of fish, throwing the owner backward
in the snow, falling himself at full length by his
side, while Frank Mansfield and his newsboy
companion sped up the street with the speed of
the wind.</p>

<p>In an instant they had turned the corner of
Cherry street and were lost to view.</p>

<p>The owner of the basket leaped to his feet, and
sprang away up the street with a bound.</p>

<p>He paid not the slightest heed to the fish scattered
around him&mdash;stopped for nothing at all.</p>

<p>"Confound the luck," muttered Detective
Hook, scrambling up as best he could. "If I
ain't a clumsy ass, there never was one! Where's
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused suddenly, and stood staring down
at the wreck of the fish-basket beneath his feet.</p>

<p>There, mingled with the fish upon the surface
of the snow, lay a heap of bright silver dollars&mdash;not
one, but ten, twenty&mdash;a hundred or more,
with three or four bags beside the pile, evidently
filled with the same sort of coin.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A STILL GREATER CRIME UNEARTHED.</p>


<p>Detective Hook stared at the strange sight
before him in dumb amazement.</p>

<p>There could be no question concerning the
genuineness of the coins displayed before him
among the masses of frozen fish scattered over
the snow-covered walk.</p>

<p>They were silver dollars, and bran new ones at
that, as fresh as on the day which they left the
coiner's hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the man who had borne this most
singular variety of fish had disappeared around
the corner of Cherry street with all possible
speed, as had the two boys but a moment before,
never pausing even to look behind him, to
all appearance utterly heedless of the loss of his
coin.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word, this is a night of adventures
for a positive fact," muttered Hook,
stooping down and examining this singular find.
"There's something crooked here, or I'm no
judge; and as I could not catch those boys if I
tried, I had best&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hello! What's this?" he added, half aloud, examining
each of the unbroken bags of dollars in
turn. "Webster National Bank, as I'm a sinner,
stamped on the bottom of each of these
bags. Here's some of the plunder now&mdash;there
can be no mistake about that."</p>

<p>It was even as he said.</p>

<p>Upon each bag, in plain black letters, the
name of the Webster Bank was plainly stamped.</p>

<p>Without a word he seized the basket and emptied
out the remainder of the fish on the snow.</p>

<p>Two other bags of smaller size appeared, one
evidently containing gold.</p>

<p>Meanwhile several persons, early purchasers
in the Catherine Market, had stopped to gaze
upon the strange sight of a well-dressed man
picking dollars out of the snow, for the detective
was now tossing into the basket the contents of
the broken bag, placing the others upon the top
of the shining heap thus formed.</p>

<p>"Here, officer," he exclaimed, beckoning to a
policeman who now suddenly appeared, bustling
out of the side door of the market opposite with
an air of authority, which suddenly changed into
one of meekness as he recognized in the man
before him one of the most noted detectives on
the New York force.</p>

<p>"I want you to take charge of these. Take
them to the Oak street station. They are part of
the haul made in a down-town bank last night."</p>

<p>The words were spoken in a tone calculated to
reach the officer's ears alone, while the little
crowd which had now gathered around stood
staring wonderingly on.</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Hook," replied the policeman,
nervously. "I just went inside the market
for a moment to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind that," returned the detective,
quickly. "I have no interest in your private affairs,
and you need have no fear of me. Now,
tell me quick, what sort of a place is that saloon
before us&mdash;the Donegal Shades? Who is this
Slattery? What sort of shop does he keep?"</p>

<p>Evidently a most law-abiding establishment,
so far as all outward appearance was concerned,
for the interior of the saloon, a moment ago
ablaze with light behind the curtains, was now
totally dark, showing no signs of life within at
all.</p>

<p>"Bad lot in there," replied the officer, briefly.</p>

<p>"Do you know them?"</p>

<p>"Some of them."</p>

<p>"Anything going on outside of regular business?"</p>

<p>"I think so, but I never could get a charge
agin 'em. There's a mighty crooked lot goes in
there, Mr. Hook; river thieves and confidence
men, to say nothing of a whole lot of dirty loafers
always hanging round inside."</p>

<p>"Just so," answered the detective, coolly.
"Now go on with your basket. Tell the captain
I'll be around in a little while."</p>

<p>He had kept his gaze fixed upon the darkened
windows of the worthy Mr. Slattery's establishment
during this brief conversation, and though
he felt that he might be mistaken, it certainly
seemed to him that he saw an eye appear at the
open space at the edge of the curtain, and as
suddenly disappear within.</p>

<p>He stepped to the door and tried the knob.</p>

<p>The door was locked, as he had supposed.</p>

<p>He raised his fist and struck blow after blow
upon it, with an evident intention of making
himself heard.</p>

<p>To attempt to conceal his identity he knew
perfectly well would be a simple impossibility.</p>

<p>He had been observed by entirely too many
persons for that.</p>

<p>Presently the door was noisily unlocked from
within, and a head covered with a fiery red shock
of tousled hair thrust outside.</p>

<p>"Well, an' what d'ye want?"</p>

<p>"To come in," replied the detective, sternly,
throwing the weight of his body against the
door. "I have a few questions for you, my man,
and don't propose to ask them here on the
street."</p>

<p>"An' who are yez, entering the house of an
honest man on the Sabbath morn? This place is
closed, I'd have ye know."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Hook, pushing his way
boldly in. "I'm a detective officer, and have no
time to waste in idle words. Your place was
running full blast a moment ago, and but for
what has just occurred would be running now.
Shut that door."</p>

<p>The man obeyed.</p>

<p>Caleb Hook stood alone in the darkened saloon
with its ruffianly-looking proprietor by his
side.</p>

<p>Few men would have cared to place themselves
in such a position, but his was a nature
which knew not the meaning of the word fear.</p>

<p>Coolly striking a match upon the bar, he touched
the gas burner above his head, and in the
light which followed glanced around him.</p>

<p>He stood within a low groggery of the ordinary
type found in this part of the city&mdash;there
was nothing singular in its appearance at all.</p>

<p>He and the red-headed individual occupied
the place alone.</p>

<p>"What's your name, my man?" he asked, at
the same time carelessly showing his shield.</p>

<p>"Slattery," was the gruff reply, "and I'll bet
it's good for more money nor yours."</p>

<p>"Very likely, but it may be good for less if
you should happen to lose your license. Who
was that old man with the basket of fish that
just went out of here?"</p>

<p>"No one went out of here. The place is
closed. I'm just after getting up out of me
bed."</p>

<p>"You lie, Slattery, and you know it!" exclaimed
the detective, sternly. "Now, answer
my questions, and I promise that you shall not
be interfered with in any way; refuse, and I
shall make it warm for you, now you may depend."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I don't know him from a crow.
He just stopped in here for a sup of beer."</p>

<p>"You saw what happened to him outside?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I did?"</p>

<p>"How long before was it that he entered your
place?"</p>

<p>"Tin minutes, mebbe&mdash;mebbe not more nor
five."</p>

<p>"And you don't know him?"</p>

<p>"I do not. I tould ye that before."</p>

<p>"And how about the old woman in the worsted
hood that entered this place a moment before
this man came out? Who was she, and where is
she now?"</p>

<p>"That? Oh, that was Mrs. Marley," replied
the saloon-keeper, with the air of a man relieved
to be questioned on a point upon which he could
answer freely at last.</p>

<p>"And who is Mrs. Marley?"</p>

<p>"The woman what lives on the top flure of
the house in the rear; she passed through by
way of the store, as she often does."</p>

<p>"What sort of a person is she?"</p>

<p>"Faix, an' ye'd better ax hersilf; I've as much
as I can do to attind to me own concerns. She
lives all alone by hersilf, pays her rint promptly,
and goes an' comes whin she likes. The neighbors
say she's mad, and mebbe she is&mdash;it's no
business at all of mine."</p>

<p>"Show me her room," said Caleb Hook, abruptly.
"I'll question her for myself."</p>

<p>"Well, then, go through the back dure, cross
the yard, and you see a house in the rear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the sort. You will go
ahead and show me the way to this woman's
room. Come, be lively, I've no time to waste."</p>

<p>The saloon-keeper hesitated for an instant,
and then moved towards the room beyond.</p>

<p>That the detective was a man not to be trifled
with he now fully realized.</p>

<p>"Come, then," he said, gruffly. "I want to
be through with this business as soon as I can,
for I've something else to do beside wasting me
time like this."</p>

<p>He opened a rear door and led the way across
a narrow courtyard.</p>

<p>A small frame dwelling stood before them.
Connecting with the street was a narrow alley,
now choked up with snow.</p>

<p>In the hurried survey of the scene taken by
the detective, he observed that the snow was
much trodden down by feet, as though several
persons had passed in and out, notwithstanding
the earliness of the hour.</p>

<p>"This way," said P. Slattery, opening the
door of the rear house and advancing up a pair
of rickety stairs.</p>

<p>The detective followed in silence.</p>

<p>Arriving at the top of the flight, the proprietor
of the Donegal Shades knocked at the door
opening immediately from the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>There was no answer from within.</p>

<p>An ominous stillness seemed to pervade the
place, which was totally dark, save for the dim
starlight which found its way through a broken
window at the end of the hall.</p>

<p>"This is blamed strange!" muttered the man,
rapping smartly again. "She can't be asleep,
for it's only just now she went in."</p>

<p>But if the strange woman whom Caleb Hook
had shadowed was within and awake, she did
not reply.</p>

<p>Except the muttered words of the man beside
him, not a sound fell upon the detective's ear.</p>

<p>A strange feeling of creeping horror seemed to
come over him&mdash;a wholly unaccountable feeling,
something which he had never experienced before.</p>

<p>Without being able to explain why, even to
himself, he was seized with a sudden desire to
penetrate behind that plain deal door, upon
which his companion was still exercising his
knuckles wholly without avail.</p>

<p>Pushing the saloon-keeper to one side, he rapped
smartly himself, at the same time grasping
the knob in his hand.</p>

<p>It yielded to his grasp&mdash;yielded so suddenly
and unexpectedly that both the detective and P.
Slattery were precipitated forward into the
room.</p>

<p>With a cry of horror bursting from his lips the
saloon-keeper sprang back toward the door.</p>

<p>"Holy Mother! what mutherin' work is this?"
he ejaculated, every several hair upon his fiery
pate seeming to rise with terror as he stared at
the sight which met the gaze of both Detective
Hook and himself.</p>

<p>For there, stretched upon the uncarpeted
boards before them, amid surroundings the most
poverty stricken, lay a fearful, sickening sight,
rendered more plainly visible by the light of a
guttering candle standing upon a plain wooden
table, which, with a bed and a chair or two,
formed the sole furniture of the room.</p>

<p>Nor was the detective scarcely less affected,
for the sight which he now beheld was one calculated
to move the strongest man.</p>

<p>The strange woman whose steps he had followed
through the streets lay before him in the dim
light of that cheerless room&mdash;dead upon the
floor.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE SECRET OF THE IRON DOOR.</p>


<p>The feeling uppermost in the mind of Frank
Mansfield, as handcuffed and helpless, caught
under the most suspicious circumstances on the
very spot where a great crime had been committed,
he accompanied Officer Schneider on the
short journey to New Church street station, was
one of hopeless despair.</p>

<p>What was the true meaning of these strange
happenings?</p>

<p>What has become of Cutts, of his unhappy
mother, and of the two boys who had detained
her beneath the church-yard wall as he himself
entered the bank?</p>

<p>He did not know.</p>

<p>He could not form even the faintest idea.</p>

<p>Until now the thought that Cutts had been
other than sincere in his request to examine the
signature book of the bank had never entered
his mind, but as he began to think serious
doubts found place therein.</p>

<p>Was not this very like a conspiracy? Did not
the whole affair bear the appearance of what is
commonly termed a put-up job?</p>

<p>Most decidedly it was so, and yet, so far as he
was aware, the boy, in spite of his misfortunes,
did not possess an enemy in the world.</p>

<p>Who, then, would be likely to go out of their
way to plot against an individual so insignificant
as himself?</p>

<p>It was at the precise moment in which Frank,
propounding that question to his troubled mind,
heard above the heads of the officer and himself
that strange, bat-like cry.</p>

<p>Again the cry was repeated, his conductor advancing
before him to ascertain its cause, as has
already been described.</p>

<p>Now, such a thought as trying to escape had
never once entered into Frank Mansfield's head.</p>

<p>Handcuffed as he stood, to attempt to run with
any hope of distancing his pursuer would have
been simple folly at best.</p>

<p>Moreover, such an action upon his part he
knew perfectly well would only add to the appearance
of guilt, quite strong enough against
him as matters already stood.</p>

<p>The German policeman had advanced before
him, and was peering up among the vines clustered
about the top of the Trinity church-yard
wall, when Frank, also looking about, perceived
close by his side one of the great iron doors, of
which there are several at this point set in the
wall, opening to the tombs built beneath the
bank which rose behind.</p>

<p>Now Frank had often noticed these doors, and
as often had carelessly wondered what sort of
looking places they might conceal.</p>

<p>Just now he gave the one before which he
stood no thought at all, his mind being occupied
by his unfortunate situation, and his immediate
attention attracted by the bat-like cry from
above.</p>

<p>His surprise was, therefore, intense when he
suddenly perceived the iron door softly open to
an extent sufficient to admit the body of a man.</p>

<p>In the aperture stood a boyish form, rendered
plainly visible by the light of a street lamp
which stood directly opposite the door itself.</p>

<p>Nor was his surprise less in recognizing in the
face before him that of a bootblack who had
every afternoon for more than a year past polished
his shoes at the close of business hours at
the bank.</p>

<p>With a quick movement the boy extended his
hand and silently beckoned to him to come in.</p>

<p>The policeman was still skirmishing along the
foot of the wall with his head in the air, for that
the whole thing occupied but the space of an instant
must be distinctly understood, and yielding
to an uncontrollable impulse, without the
slightest thought of what the result of such action
might be, Frank stepped within the iron door
by the bootblack's side.</p>

<p>In an instant the door was noiselessly closed
behind him, rendering the darkness entire.</p>

<p>The boy, without a word, took Frank by the
arm and led him forward, up several steps, and
opening a second door of iron like the first, ushered
him into a low-vaulted apartment not higher
than his head.</p>

<p>"There you are, Mr. Mansfield," said the boy,
respectfully. "I tought I could do it, an' I have.
I'd like to see the cop as could catch onto yer
now!"</p>

<p>"Why, you're Barney, the bootblack, ain't
you?" demanded Frank, glancing about him in
curious surprise.</p>

<p>Within the vault&mdash;for it was nothing more,
nor larger than a small-sized bedroom&mdash;was a
table with dishes upon it, a lamp burning in
their midst, a chair or two standing about, and
piles of old carpets and faded blankets rolled out
upon the stone floor.</p>

<p>Nothing else was to be seen about this strange
dwelling-place save a short ladder leading up
toward the vaulted brick arch above their heads,
down which at this moment two ragged boys
came scrambling with all possible speed.</p>

<p>At the same instant Frank heard just such a
sound as that which a heavy stone dropped upon
frozen ground might make.</p>

<p>The two boys sprang from the ladder to the
floor of the vault, laughing aloud.</p>

<p>"We fixed him, Barney!" cried one, giving utterance
at the same time to the strange, bat-like
cry which had so puzzled the worthy Schneider.
"He's running up and down the wall, swearing
every Dutch swear he knows. An' dis is your
friend, is it? I suppose de fellers will kill us for
what we've done, but it's too late to help it
now."</p>

<p>"Bully for you, Sandy! Garibaldi, you're a
trump! Dere's nothing mean about this gent
wot I've been a-shinin' of fer more nor a year,
you bet. They've jest been a-playin' it onto
him, an' I knew it. In course I couldn't
stand by quiet like and see him took'n in."</p>

<p>"Barney, what does all this mean?" cried
Frank, regarding the boys and their strange
surroundings with looks of unfeigned surprise.</p>

<p>"It means that those two fellows, Ed Wilson
and Jim Morrow, have gone back on you, Mr.
Mansfield, and put up the job with Cutts, the
detective to get you into a hole. You are wid
the bats now and dey'll see yer all right, and
don't make no mistake."</p>

<p>"Put up a job on me! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Look at dem bracelets wot you have on yer
hands and then ax me. Cutts paid Jim and Ed
to rope you in, an' I s'pose somebody's a-payin'
of him. We fellers seen the bank robbers go out,
an' one of de bats is a-follerin' of 'em now to
spot where dey live. If you don't believe me,
look a-here&mdash;here's a hull lot of things wot dey
dropped!"</p>

<p>The boy stooped, and from beneath the pile of
old carpet and blankets in one corner of the
vault drew out a small tin box filled with a number
of documents, which he emptied upon the
table among a mass of broken dishes, bread and
scraps of meat, with which the table was already
covered.</p>

<p>"There dey am," said Barney, triumphantly.
"You've been kind to me, Mister Mansfield, and
I'm not the feller to go back on you. The boss
of de gang dropped 'em, an' me an' Sandy picked
'em up. An' we didn't say nuthin' to them two
sick bats, Jim Morrow an' Ed Wilson, about our
find, an' now I'm mighty glad of it, too."</p>

<p>The box was marked "Webster National
Bank" in black letters painted upon its side.</p>

<p>Instantly Frank recognized it as a box filled
with various private documents, intrusted for
safe-keeping to the bank, which he had often
seen quietly reposing within the rifled vault.</p>

<p>And his heart bounded for joy as he gazed
upon it.</p>

<p>If these boys, whoever and whatever they
might be, had witnessed the robbery, then with
the aid of their testimony, and this box to corroborate
it, he would have no trouble in proving
his own innocence before the world.</p>

<p>"Speak, Barney!" he exclaimed, eagerly.
"What place is this&mdash;what do you know of the
robbery of the bank? Tell me all about it, and
tell me slowly, so that I may be able to understand."</p>

<p>"Well, den, Mister Mansfield, it's jest like dis,"
replied the bootblack, with the air of one who
had suddenly attained greatness, and was fully
aware of it, his companions gazing admiringly
at him as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Fust we fellers are wot dey call de 'bats in
de wall,' or, in plain United States, a lot of chaps
wot find it more convenient to live in dis here
snug little hole than to sleep on the trucks when
the winter-time comes on. Ter-night, as Sandy
an' me an' another feller was a-comin' in from
the thayter, we happened to see three fellers
a-comin' out of the side door of the bank."</p>

<p>"The Webster Bank?" cried Frank, trembling
with excitement.</p>

<p>"Of course. Wot other do you s'pose? We
was a-comin' down Rector street just as these
three fellers come a-sneakin' out.</p>

<p>"We skinned over the church-yard fence, an'
give 'em the bat-call, wot we gives to de fellers
of our gang to let dem know we're around.</p>

<p>"Giminnetti! you'd orter see 'em cut round
the corner, an' the foremost of them dropped
this here box in the snow."</p>

<p>"I see it all!" cried Frank, bitterly. "Cutts
knew of this intended robbery, and planned to
have suspicion thrown upon me. Fool that I
was to listen to his lying words!"</p>

<p>"Betcher life," replied Barney, sententiously.
"Hold up fer a minute, an' I'll tell you all about
that, too."</p>

<p>But Frank Mansfield failed to reply.</p>

<p>Moving toward the pile of documents, he had,
as well as his manacled hands would allow him,
opened the one nearest the edge of the table, and
was now examining it by the uncertain light of
the lamp.</p>

<p>What was this?</p>

<p>Surely there must be some mistake!</p>

<p>But no&mdash;here it was all down in black and
white.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And I do give and bequeath to the said

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN WHICH FRANK MANSFIELD MAKES AN IMPORTANT
DISCOVERY.</p>


<p>Had it occurred to Officer Schneider to remain
quietly in the precise spot at which his prisoner
had disappeared until the Trinity Church clock
struck the hour of four, his patience would have
been rewarded by seeing the iron door in the
grave-yard wall cautiously open, and the head
and shoulders of a boy thrust out into the silent
street.</p>

<p>But as neither that exceedingly astute member
of the New York police force&mdash;the finest in
America, we believe it has been said&mdash;nor any
one else was about at the time, the head and
shoulders were followed by a well-developed
pair of arms and legs, and a boy stepped out
upon the snow.</p>

<p>Instantly this boy was followed by another,
after which the iron door was softly closed from
within.</p>

<p>Turning their faces toward the north, both
boys started upon the dead run up New Church
street, and whipping around the corner of Cedar
street like a flash, suddenly slackened their
steps, and began slowly to ascend the hill in the
direction of Broadway.</p>

<p>In the stillness of the Sabbath morning not a
sound is to be heard.</p>

<p>The great city sleeps, its ceaseless roar is
hushed.</p>

<p>Even as the virtue of charity covereth a multitude
of sins, so has covered the pure snow
everything in and about these silent streets with
an unbroken mantle of white.</p>

<p>Let us glance at these two solitary travelers as
they move along, and seek to learn who and
what they may be.</p>

<p>As to the larger of the pair there can be no
doubt.</p>

<p>Frank Mansfield disguised or Frank Mansfield
in his usual dress must to the reader, who has
free admission to all our secrets, be Frank Mansfield
still.</p>

<p>And we find him now clad in a rough, well-worn
suit of clothes, with a blue woolen shirt
and a low, slouch, felt hat, not unlike the garments
which a few hours since we saw adorning
the person of Barney, the bootblack, one of the
"bats" in the vault of the church-yard wall.</p>

<p>But his hands are free&mdash;there is no doubt of
that, for he has one inserted in each side-pocket
of his short monkey-coat as he hurries along by
the side of his companion through the snow.</p>

<p>And for this relief, one may as well say right
here, Frank had to thank a sharp file, procured
by one of his new-found friends and Master
Barney's strength of arm.</p>

<p>As to the second boy, he is likewise a "bat
from the wall."</p>

<p>The special "bat," in fact, mentioned by Barney
in his graphic description of the robbery of
the Webster Bank as having taken upon himself
to track the burglars to their home.</p>

<p>He was a well-built fellow of some eighteen or
nineteen years, rough and uncouth in his dress
and speech, but immeasurably superior, as could
be seen at a glance, to either of his companions
encountered by Frank in the vault.</p>

<p>He rejoiced among his fellow "bats" in the
short and easily-remembered appellation of
"Jerry Buck."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you'd know the place again,
Jerry?" asked Frank, as they walked along.</p>

<p>It was for the purpose of pointing out the
house into which the three bank-robbers had
disappeared that the two boys had now sallied
forth.</p>

<p>"Positive," replied the boy, quickly. "It was
down in Cherry street, just behind the Catherine
Market. I never let up on 'em till I seed 'em go
in."</p>

<p>"There were three of them, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;one big feller with a carpet-bag, his
head all tied up in a comforter, and two others,
one with a big bag over his shoulder, an' the
other with nothin' at all."</p>

<p>As Frank said nothing further, and his companion
evinced an equal disinclination to talk,
the boys, having now turned into Broadway,
moved along in silence until they reached the
newspaper offices which line the right-hand side
of Park Row and Printing House Square.</p>

<p>At each one of these they made a halt, Jerry
Buck entering at the basement doors, and elbowing
his way among a crowd of men and boys,
emerged with an ever increasing bundle of morning
papers under his arm.</p>

<p>For Jerry was a newsboy as well as a "bat in
the wall," and had his living to get on Sunday
as upon the other days of the week.</p>

<p>"Now, we won't stop no more," he said briefly,
as his complement of papers was completed
at last. "Let's hurry up, for as soon as it's
light I've got to get to work."</p>

<p>He turned into Frankfort street as he spoke,
and leading the way past the great arches of the
Brooklyn Bridge, entered Cherry street at its
junction with Franklin square.</p>

<p>Continuing along that thoroughfare, clean to
the eye at least for once, the boys passed the
end of the Catherine Market, and at a sign from
Jerry came to a halt before a dirty brick tenement.</p>

<p>"That's the place," he said. "I saw them all
three go in that door."</p>

<p>"You are sure?"</p>

<p>"Certain. I can't make no mistake about it,
for I used to live in that house once myself."</p>

<p>"And I suppose they are there now, the miserable
scoundrels," exclaimed Frank, looking up
at the house. "Jerry, I think the best thing I
can do is to go directly and inform the police."</p>

<p>"Maybe it is. You've got education and
ought to know better than I, but there's another
road out of this place by way of the alley in the
rear. Perhaps I'd better show you that first."</p>

<p>He led the way around the corner into Catherine
street, and paused before an old tumble-down
rookery bearing the sign "The Donegal
Shades, by P. Slattery," above the door.</p>

<p>Here in the neighborhood of the busy market
there were signs of abundant life.</p>

<p>Men, women and boys were moving up and
down the sidewalk, to and fro, bent on their various
affairs.</p>

<p>"That's the place," said Jerry, pointing toward
an alley leading to the rear of the saloon.</p>

<p>As Frank raised his eyes in response to the
sign a man sprang toward them with a loud
shout.</p>

<p>It was the detective who had arrested him at
the bank that night.</p>

<p>By the light of a neighboring street-lamp
Frank recognized him at a glance.</p>

<p>With an exclamation he sprang away just as
the man's hand was stretched out to grasp his
coat, and, followed by Jerry Buck, who did not
comprehend the situation at all, dashed up the
street with the speed of the wind, without pausing
to look behind.</p>

<p>But Jerry was possessed of no such fears as at
that moment filled our hero's breast.</p>

<p>As they turned the corner of Cherry street he
shot a hurried glance behind him and beheld the
singular accident already described, which served
to bring the detective to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>"Hist! hist!" he whispered, seizing Frank by
the arm. "He's down, and there comes one of
the bank burglars now!"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the man who had dropped
the basket of fish dashed round the corner and
past them up Cherry street at the top of his
speed.</p>

<p>"That's the one wot carried the bag!" whispered
the boy, excitedly. "Who's the feller that
made you cut an' run?"</p>

<p>"The detective what arrested me&mdash;I don't
know his name."</p>

<p>"The deuce? Well, you don't want him to
see you, and there's no danger of it. I can give
him the slip twenty times in this neighborhood&mdash;never
you fear. If yer a-goin' to give
yerself up you' better do it. Don't let that fellow
take you in, or they won't believe a word
you say."</p>

<p>But the detective on whom their eyes were
fixed from around the corner of the building by
the side of which they stood, showed no disposition
to follow.</p>

<p>On the contrary.</p>

<p>He remained stooping over the basket dropped
by the flying man in the snow.</p>

<p>As the boys watched him there emerged from
the alley at the side of the Donegal Shades two
men, who, moving unobserved through the crowd
which had now gathered about the building, hurried
up Catherine street, passed within two feet
of the spot where the boys now were.</p>

<p>"I know the big fellow," whispered Jerry
Buck, seizing Frank by the arm. "That's another
of them&mdash;that's the fellow who carried the
carpet-bag away from the bank."</p>

<p>But Frank Mansfield made no response.</p>

<p>He stood staring at the vanishing forms like
one in a trance.</p>

<p>If the larger of the two men was one of the
robbers of the Webster Bank, what was his companion
doing in such company as his?</p>

<p>For the man who walked by the burglar's side
was the old-time friend of the boy himself&mdash;was
the father of the girl he loved&mdash;that most respectable
stock operator and member of the Tenth
Baptist Church, Elijah Callister, and no one else!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN THE CHAMBER OF DEATH.</p>


<p>Caleb Hook stared at the fearful sight which
in that darkened chamber met his gaze with
feelings of mingled horror and surprise.</p>

<p>Could this, indeed, be the strange creature
whose footsteps he had followed&mdash;who but a
few short moments before he had seen in life.</p>

<p>It was hard to realize it, but there could be no
doubt that such was the fact.</p>

<p>There lay the same attenuated form, the same
pale and worn features, the thin gray hair, now
falling in a tangled mass to the floor, behind the
head.</p>

<p>And the restless eyes had ceased their wandering
at last, stilled by the cold hand of death.</p>

<p>Upon the woman's forehead a fearful bruise
was plainly to be seen as the detective stooped,
and, by the light of the candle which he had
seized from the table, examined the inanimate
form.</p>

<p>It was such a mark as a man's fist might make
upon the right temple above the eye.</p>

<p>There was nothing save this fearful bruise,
which in itself would have been enough to have
felled the strongest man, far less a frail woman
like this.</p>

<p>Caleb Hook set the candle upon the floor, and
taking the woman's hand in his own, silently felt
her pulse.</p>

<p>It had ceased to beat&mdash;the hand was already
cold.</p>

<p>"Is she dead?" demanded the saloon-keeper,
in a frightened whisper.</p>

<p>"She certainly is," replied the detective.
"Can you look at her and ask? That blow must
have been the work of a powerful man&mdash;coward,
I should rather say, whoever he was, to use a
woman so."</p>

<p>"God save us! an' yer right," exclaimed Slattery,
with a shudder. "An' she was a dacent
body, if she war mad. Bad luck to the murtherin'
spalpane who raised his hand agin her. I
would I had me own two hands about his
throat!"</p>

<p>As the warm-hearted Irishman uttered these
words, with some evidence of deep feeling, the
sound of footsteps was heard on the stairs without,
and a stout woman, bare-headed and so
lightly dressed as to leave a strong suspicion in
the minds of the two men who beheld her that
she had just left her bed, now bustled into the
room.</p>

<p>"An' what's all the row up here?" she demanded.
"There's noise enough to wake the
dead."</p>

<p>"But not enough to wake yon poor crayter,
Mrs. O'Brien!" exclaimed Slattery, grimly, pointing
at the same time toward the body of the
woman on the floor. "D'ye know what's been
goin' on up here? Poor Mrs. Marley's after bein'
murdered."</p>

<p>"Holy Vargin! an' is it murther that's been
done?" cried the woman, who, having caught
sight of the body, now sprang toward the door,
extending her hands before her, as if to ward off
the sight.</p>

<p>"Help! Murder! Perlice! Och, an' it's bad
luck that's overtook me respictible house!"</p>

<p>Before the hand of the detective could be raised
to stay her, the frightened creature had rushed
down the stairs, through the alley and out into
the street, causing the air to ring with her cries
of murder and her shouts for the police.</p>

<p>"It's the woman down stairs," said Slattery
aghast. "Sure, an' it's the whole worruld we'll
have in to join us now."</p>

<p>Caleb Hook made no reply.</p>

<p>He cared little, in fact, who entered this chamber
of death and who stayed away.</p>

<p>He could not be everywhere, and had no desire
to take charge of the case.</p>

<p>The woman was dead, and her knowledge concerning
the robbery of the Webster Bank must
remain forever untold.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he realized fully that between
the robbery and this murder there was unquestionably
a connecting link.</p>

<p>In all human probability the secrets possessed
by this unfortunate creature had cost her life.</p>

<p>He kneeled beside the body and made a hurried
examination of her clothes, Slattery talking
volubly as he did so, and, professing his entire
innocence of any knowledge of the affair.</p>

<p>But the search was fruitless.</p>

<p>Save for a few cheap personal belongings, there
was nothing found upon the woman of any interest
at all.</p>

<p>He had scarce completed his work, before the
sound of many footsteps was heard upon the
stairs, and a motley crowd pressed their way into
the room.</p>

<p>Men from the market, men from the street.</p>

<p>Butchers, fishmongers, and housewives with
their baskets, on their way to purchase their
morning supplies.</p>

<p>Close behind them came a policeman, who elbowed
his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>Into the hands of this man the detective resigned
the case, informing him of his own identity
and of the facts connected with the discovery
of the body.</p>

<p>"I'll go around to the Oak street station at
once, officer," he added in a whisper, "and send
you help. Meanwhile, keep an eye on that man
Slattery, if you want my advice. Better keep
him in here with you&mdash;I'll send these people
away.</p>

<p>"Get back there!" he said, sternly, facing the
crowd now pressing about the door. "Get
back, every one of you! The law will attend to
this matter without your help!"</p>

<p>He pushed back a brawny butcher as he spoke,
who, with his check frock hanging to his heels,
had pushed his way beyond the rest within the
little room.</p>

<p>At the same instant a slight stir was observed
among those beyond, and a young man with pallid
features and whitened lips tightly set pushed
his way into the room.</p>

<p>He was followed by a second youth but little
younger than himself, who held a bundle of
newspapers beneath his arm.</p>

<p>Detective Hook started back with an exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p>Before him stood the very pair who had eluded
his grasp in the street but a few moments before.</p>

<p>It was Frank Mansfield and his newsboy companion,
Jerry Buck.</p>

<p>Attracted by the outcry in the street and impelled
by a desire for which he was wholly unable
to account, Frank had followed the crowd
through the alley and up the rickety stairs,
wholly regardless of results.</p>

<p>Springing forward, he now sank beside the
body of the unfortunate woman with a low, horror-stricken
cry.</p>

<p>Instantly the detective's hand was upon his
shoulder and had gently, but firmly, raised him
to his feet.</p>

<p>The boy stared at him wildly.</p>

<p>"Let me go," he said hoarsely, pulling himself
away. "Send away these people! leave me
alone with my dead!"</p>

<p>"Your dead, young man? Is that woman anything
to you?"</p>

<p>"She is my mother!" cried Frank, kneeling by
the side of the body, and taking the cold, white
hand within his own.</p>

<p>"She is my mother, and I, who basely left her
to the hands of others, am responsible for this&mdash;I,
her most unworthy son!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AN UNEXPECTED ALLY.</p>


<p>For a moment no one spoke.</p>

<p>The kneeling boy wept by the side of the woman's
body upon the floor, the crowd falling back
to make way for him of their own accord.</p>

<p>"Come, my boy," said Detective Hook, at
length, laying his hand with womanly tenderness
upon Frank's shoulder, "this is no place for you.
The coroner has a duty here; meanwhile you had
better come with me."</p>

<p>The boy arose obediently.</p>

<p>Forcing back the crowd, the detective closed
the door of the little room behind him, and taking
Frank by the arm, he led him to the street
without speaking a word.</p>

<p>To Jerry Buck, who had followed them through
the alley and now stood with his bundle of newspapers
under his arm staring at them wonderingly,
he paid no attention at all.</p>

<p>At this moment the policeman who, at the detective's
orders, had taken the stolen dollars to
the Oak Street station, came hurrying up.</p>

<p>Releasing his hold on Frank's arm, Caleb Hook
drew the man aside and whispered a few hurried
words in his ear.</p>

<p>The policeman turned abruptly and hurried
back in the direction from which he had come.</p>

<p>"That man will see that all proper steps are
taken for the care of the remains of your unfortunate
mother," said the detective, quietly,
"which leaves me free to attend to you."</p>

<p>"Now, my boy, I want to talk with you. I
know you to be the same person who has twice
given me the slip to-night, and by right ought to
handcuff you and take you to the station at
once. But, although it may surprise you, I don't
propose to do anything of the sort, for I think it
unnecessary to resort to such means."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you now, sir," replied Frank, in
a broken voice. "I was just going to give myself
up. I shall not try to escape again."</p>

<p>"Good!" replied the man, putting his arm
through that of the boy and moving up Catherine
street as he spoke. "I flatter myself I can
read men's faces as well as the next, and that is
why I have determined to place confidence in
you. I may deem it my duty to arrest you yet.
Very likely I shall; but before I do so I am going
to have a quiet talk with you, when I'm certain
you'll see the advantage of telling me the whole
truth about this bank affair, and in order that
we may be undisturbed I propose to take you to
my own room, which, fortunately, is not far off."</p>

<p>Now the room occupied by Caleb Hook&mdash;for
he was a bachelor, and had no one to care for
but himself&mdash;was situated in a respectable lodging-house
in Madison street, between Montgomery
and Clinton.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the detective himself entered
the apartment, followed by the youthful
assistant cashier of the Webster National Bank.</p>

<p>It was a large room on the second floor of the
house.</p>

<p>The furniture was modern and abundant,
giving to the interior a thoroughly comfortable
air.</p>

<p>Locking the door behind him and lighting a
handsome drop-light, Detective Hook touched a
match to a fire already laid in the open grate,
which in a moment broke into a cheerful blaze.</p>

<p>"Now then, young man," he said, pulling off
his overcoat, and drawing up a comfortable easy
chair, "you are my guest for the present, whether
I conclude to turn you over to the authorities
later on or not. Sit down there, and make yourself
at home."</p>

<p>Frank seated himself wearily and remained
gazing at the fire without reply.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Caleb Hook studied his face in silence.</p>

<p>"Was that woman really your mother?" he
said at length.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The boy had burst into tears, burying his face
in his hands.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said the detective, sympathizingly,
putting his hand gently upon his shoulder,
"I had a mother once, whom I loved better than
any one in the world. Dear me! she died a dozen
years ago.</p>

<p>"You've had a great deal of trouble," he added,
after a short pause. "I can see that at a
glance. Now, do you know, Frank, that two-thirds
of the scrapes people get themselves into
come from lying? Suppose your mother were to
speak to you now? Don't you think she would
advise you to tell me all you know about this
bank affair? Come, now, I'm sure she would."</p>

<p>"She would as she once was," replied Frank,
bitterly; "but my mother has been insane for
the last five years, and in an asylum. God only
knows how she came to escape to meet her death
to-night."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it, my boy, tell me all
about it," said Hook, familiarly, and in the most
sympathizing tones. "If there is any way in
the world to help you, count on me every time."</p>

<p>It was the favorite motto of this famous man
that to understand the motive of a criminal it
was only necessary to lead him to believe that
your sympathy lay wholly with himself.</p>

<p>Personally, he fully believed the boy before
him to have had a hand in the bank robbery.</p>

<p>Nor was this strange.</p>

<p>Had he not caught him almost in the act?</p>

<p>If he could, by working upon his feelings in
these, the first moments of his bitter sorrow,
bring him to confess, much trouble to himself
and much expense to the police in working out
a troublesome case might thus be saved.</p>

<p>It was with this end in view that he had
adopted this unusual course.</p>

<p>Nor were his efforts unrewarded.</p>

<p>Frank opened his heart without further pressure,
and related truthfully all that had occurred.</p>

<p>One thing only he concealed&mdash;the secret of the
"Bats in the Wall."</p>

<p>The boys had befriended him in his moment of
need.</p>

<p>He was firmly resolved that no amount of pressure
should draw from him the secret of their
hiding-place, which through their kindness to
himself he had learned.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, this is a most remarkable
story," exclaimed the detective, gazing at Frank
with a puzzled air as he completed his tale. "But
you have omitted to tell me how it is that having
handcuffed you myself, and delivered you into
the charge of an officer, you managed to escape
as you did."</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that, sir," replied the boy,
firmly. "It would not help you any so far as
tracing the bank-robbers are concerned to know."</p>

<p>"You say you met some boys who saw the
burglars, who showed you a box of papers, which
they had dropped in their flight, from which you
took this will of which you have given me so
strange an account. Did these boys have anything
to do with your escape?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they did and perhaps they didn't&mdash;they
proved my friends, and I shan't give them
away."</p>

<p>"That's right, never go back on your friends.
Now, then, Frank Mansfield, do you know who I
am?"</p>

<p>"I know you are a detective."</p>

<p>"So I am. My name is Caleb Hook."</p>

<p>"I've often heard of you," said Frank, regarding
him with some curiosity.</p>

<p>And who has not!</p>

<p>The name of Caleb Hook has for years been
the most famous of the New York force.</p>

<p>"No doubt," replied that individual, quietly.
"But to return to our subject in which I am
becoming more interested every moment. I see
deeper into things than you can expect to, my
boy, and let me tell you in what you have related
I see evidences of a deep and carefully laid
scheme, of which this bank robbery forms only
a part. Let me see that will you found in the
box."</p>

<p>Frank took the document from his pocket and
placed it in his hands.</p>

<p>"I've had no time to read it through," he said.</p>

<p>The detective opened the paper, the seals of
which had already been broken when Frank first
found it, and perused it in silence.</p>

<p>"My boy," said he, as he came to the end, "let
me tell you that this document is likely to prove
of the greatest value to you. In it the testator&mdash;your
grandfather, you say he is&mdash;relates that he
has converted all his property, valued at over
half a million, into gold and gems and has
buried it in a place described in a sealed parchment
which ought to accompany this will. All
of this is to be yours at the age of twenty-two,
under certain conditions; until then the document
is to be secret, and its contents remain unknown.
Now, where is that sealed parchment?
That's the question before the house!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't tell," replied Frank, in astonishment.
"It may be with the other papers
in the box. Half a million! and all for me!
And we all thought my grandfather died poor!"</p>

<p>"It is very evident he did nothing of the sort.
Jeremiah Mansfield&mdash;Jeremiah Mansfield&mdash;let me
see&mdash;wasn't that the miserly old fellow who was
murdered in Harlem some five years ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes: his house was entered by burglars in
the night. They killed him, and no property except
the old house was ever found, although until
then my father thought him to be rich."</p>

<p>"And it seems he was right," replied Hook,
musingly. "Then your father was Francis
Mansfield, the foreign importer, who was said&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They said he stole one hundred thousand
dollars of the funds of a European house intrusted
to his keeping!" cried Frank, with deeply
flushed face, "but it was false. The money arrived
too late for deposit, father put it over
night in his safe. Burglars entered the store
that night, blew up the safe and stole every cent.
It killed my father to be thought a defaulter, drove
my mother mad, and ruined us all."</p>

<p>"Just so," answered the detective; "I remember
it all perfectly well. It was a sad case,
indeed."</p>

<p>For a few moments he remained silently musing,
still holding the open paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"Who is this man Callister?" he asked, at
length. "Is it the Wall street speculator of that
name?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He was my father's best friend."</p>

<p>"And it was he whom you saw coming out of
that alley with the other man that Jerry Buck,
the newsboy, told you was one of the burglars?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure of it. I know him too well to
make a mistake."</p>

<p>"And I know him, too," muttered Hook,
"and I propose to know him better by and by.
You observe that he is one of the witnesses to
your grandfather's will!" he added, aloud.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Now, Frank, let me tell you something you
don't know, but might have known if you had
taken the trouble to read this document carefully.
Listen to this clause in your grandfather's
will, which has a most important bearing on this
case:</p>

<p>"'And if, at the age of twenty-two, my grandson,
the said Frank Mansfield, shall be found to
be honest and upright, and in every way a reputable
member of society, the sealed parchment,
together with the buried treasure which it represents,
which I deem unsafe, in these days of
fraud, to intrust to the keeping of any bank,
shall be delivered to him, and shall become his
sole property by virtue of this my last will. If,
however, the said Frank Mansfield shall have become
deceased, or if he shall have been at any
time proven guilty of any unlawful act, then this,
my last will and testament, together with the accompanying
parchment and the buried treasure
it represents, shall be given to my good friend,
Elijah Callister, of the City of New York, to become
his sole property, under the provisions of
this will.'"</p>

<p>"And knowing this, Mr. Callister tried to
have me convicted of crime!" cried Frank,
springing to his feet in great excitement. "Can
it be possible that the man is so base?"</p>

<p>"Young man, it looks tremendously like it,"
said Caleb Hook, decidedly, folding up the will
and putting it in his own pocket.</p>

<p>"You tell me that Cutts led you into this
affair&mdash;and I want you to understand for what
you proposed to do you are most decidedly to
blame&mdash;that he agreed to pay these boys, Ed Wilson
and Jim Morrow, who, according to the story
told by them to that boy Barney, have undoubtedly
left already in the early morning train for
California, where, had the plot succeeded, they
could never have been reached to prove your
innocence, even had they been so disposed.</p>

<p>"Now, if Cutts paid them&mdash;and Cutts is crooked,
if he is a detective; I've known that this
long while&mdash;the question is who was to pay
Cutts? My answer would be this man Callister,
whose direct interest it is to have you convicted
of crime."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hook," exclaimed the boy, lost in astonishment,
"I am completely bewildered.
What would you advise me to do?"</p>

<p>"To place yourself in my hands, if you will,"
answered the detective, decidedly. "I will
take up your case if you wish me to do so, for it
is just the sort of an affair I like.</p>

<p>"I now fully believe your story, my boy, and
shall not place you under arrest. In working
for your interests I shall also be doing my duty
in unearthing the robbers of the Webster Bank."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall be only too glad of your
help," said Frank, eagerly. "I have been foolish&mdash;I
see it now. Whatever you say I'll do."</p>

<p>"Then, inasmuch as you have mysteriously
disappeared, remain so. I've reported your disappearance
to the police; let it be your care
not to reappear until I say the word.</p>

<p>"Disguise yourself, watch Callister, see your
bootblacks and newsboys, and procure from
them the tin box and all it contains. I will do
for your unfortunate mother all that can be done.
When you want money come to me. We will
work together, Frank, and as I don't work for
nothing, you can repay me when you come into
your own."</p>

<p>"I can never repay you, sir!" cried the boy,
with tears in his eyes, grasping the detective's
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can, and I'm sure you will. Here
are a few dollars now. When you need it you
shall have more. Now go, and don't be seen in
the streets so dressed that any one will recognize
you again. You can meet me&mdash;let me see&mdash;I've
got to go out of town this afternoon on
important business, and won't return until late
to-night. Meet me where I saw you first&mdash;on the
corner of Rector street and Broadway&mdash;to-night,
as the clock of old Trinity strikes twelve."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WHAT WAS SEEN BY THE CHURCH-YARD WALL.</p>


<p>The Sabbath has passed, and night has fallen
upon the city once more.</p>

<p>The busy streets are growing deserted, and the
great business thoroughfares about lower Broadway,
silent at all hours on this the day of rest,
have, as the night wears on, become almost entirely
abandoned by pedestrians, and have sunk
into obscurity and gloom.</p>

<p>As the midnight hour approached, the figure
of a young man, roughly dressed in garments of
the commonest sort, his face concealed beneath
a low slouch hat, his mouth by a heavy black
mustache, might have been observed to briskly
ascend the Rector street hill, which rises along
the church-yard wall, and to take his station at
the corner of Broadway, close by the side of the
iron fence which divides the old burial ground
from the street.</p>

<p>He was evidently waiting for some one, for as
he paced up and down beneath the cold light of
the glittering stars his eye was from time to time
turned upon the clock in the church tower, now
about to strike the hour of twelve.</p>

<p>No one that had ever known Frank Mansfield
would have recognized the neatly dressed young
bank clerk in this rough looking youth who now
strode uneasily up and down.</p>

<p>And yet it was none other than Frank himself,
cleverly disguised, prompt on the hour of his
appointment with Detective Hook.</p>

<p>Nor was that famous officer at all behindhand.</p>

<p>Just as the clock of old Trinity rang out the
midnight hour the boy perceived him moving at
a rapid pace down Broadway.</p>

<p>Clever as was Frank's disguise, it did not deceive
the detective for an instant.</p>

<p>"Well, young man, you are on time, I see?"
he said, abruptly, peering beneath the low
slouched hat. "What have you learned? You
have got the sealed parchment that should accompany
the will, I hope? Otherwise, your
chances of finding your legacy are mighty slim."</p>

<p>"I have learned nothing, excepting the fact
that my mother escaped from the private asylum
up-town where she had been confined over a
week ago."</p>

<p>"And the parchment?"</p>

<p>"Was not in the box, Mr. Hook. Here it is,
with all the papers it contained. I have examined
every one of them, and it is not there."</p>

<p>He drew a small tin box from beneath his coat
as he spoke and placed it in the detective's
hands.</p>

<p>"That's bad for us," replied Caleb Hook,
opening the box and examining the papers one
by one. "These seem to relate to all sorts of
matters. Surely this cannot be the box in which
the will was originally contained."</p>

<p>"I can't say&mdash;it is all that was found by the
boys. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seek not the parchment. Watch and wait,
for the day of vengeance is at hand!"</p>

<p>Plainly heard by both the man and the boy,
these words rang out upon the silence of the
deserted street.</p>

<p>"Who spoke?" exclaimed the detective,
springing back from the church-yard rail against
which he had been leaning.</p>

<p>Save himself and his companion, not a soul
was to be seen either on Rector street or Broadway.</p>

<p>With a low cry the boy had seized him by the
arm.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there!" he whispered, trembling with
excitement, pointing, at the same time to the
open expanse of the Trinity church-yard within
the rail, by the side of which they stood.</p>

<p>The eyes of Caleb Hook followed the direction
indicated by Frank's hand.</p>

<p>There, moving among the headstones in the
shadow of the church itself, was the form of a
woman, cheaply dressed in a faded calico, an old
shawl and a woolen hood.</p>

<p>She was tall and thin, and her long gray hair
hung in a tangled mass down her neck and
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Great God! if it ain't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My mother!" cried the boy aloud, springing
toward the rail. "It is! It is! Look! she faces
us now. God have mercy! What can this
mean?"</p>

<p>The form had paused, and, turning, gazed sorrowfully
toward the astonished pair beneath the
stars which glistened above.</p>

<p>But, feeble as was their light, Detective
Hook recognized in that care-worn face, at a
glance, the features of the strange woman whom
he had tracked through the streets on the previous
night, and who, to his positive knowledge
now lay dead in the city morgue!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN CAGNEY'S SANCTUM.</p>


<p>We never heard it claimed that Oliver street
was fashionable.</p>

<p>If such a claim was made, many who know
that narrow lane, extending from Chatham
square down to the East River front, would be
inclined to dispute its truth.</p>

<p>Crossing Cherry street, Water and Front, passing
directly through the heart of the densely
populated Fourth Ward, long known as the home
of the toughest of the "toughs" who infest the
City of New York, it would be useless for us to
pretend that Oliver street was anything else than
just what it is&mdash;as bad as bad can be.</p>

<p>Not that many excellent people cannot be
found within its limits.</p>

<p>That is true of every city street, no matter
how poor its seeming; but Michael J. Cagney
was certainly not one of these, nor was his saloon&mdash;"The
Fourth Ward Shades"&mdash;any better
than it ought to be, if common rumor was to be
believed.</p>

<p>And yet Cagney did a flourishing business&mdash;there
could be no doubt as to that.</p>

<p>It was open all day, it could be entered at
night, nor upon the Sabbath were the thirsty
turned away.</p>

<p>How Mr. Michael J. Cagney managed to arrange
matters with the excise commissioners is
no concern of ours.</p>

<p>In the present stage of the events of this narrative
we are concerned only with two individuals,
who, at the hour of daybreak on the particular
Sunday morning of the visit of Frank
Mansfield and Jerry Buck to the Catherine Market,
entered quietly at Cagney's little side door.</p>

<p>They were none other than the two men who
had emerged from the alley at the side of the
Donegal Shades, one of whom it will be recollected,
Frank recognized as that most reputable
member of society, Mr. Elijah Callister, the
well-known operator on the stock exchange, and
the other the man pointed out by Jerry Buck as
one of the burglars of the Webster Bank.</p>

<p>Pushing against the door, to all appearance
tightly fastened, but which instantly yielded to
their touch, the two men found themselves within
a dirty bar-room.</p>

<p>Bottles and demijohns lined the grimy shelves,
great casks and barrels were piled from the level
of the sawdust-covered floor in double tiers
around two sides of the room.</p>

<p>Upon the top of these barrels lay four or five
ragged men, some young, some old, all sprawled
out without reference to the gracefulness of
the position shown and all sound asleep.</p>

<p>These were the drunkards of the Saturday
night previous, taken from the floor, to which
they had fallen under the influence of the vile
poison imbibed at this and other bars, and
thrown upon the top of these barrels to sleep off
the effects of their debauch.</p>

<p>The two men paid no attention to this&mdash;a
common Sunday morning spectacle in many low
saloons&mdash;but with a nod to the sleepy, red-eyed
bartender passed through a swinging half door,
which formed to a certain extent at least, a dividing
line between Cagney's proper and Cagney's
private sanctum beyond.</p>

<p>It was only a little 7x8 affair, in the center of
which stood a table, and one or two hard wooden
chairs, all a shade less dirty than the room
beyond.</p>

<p>The stock operator seated himself at the table
upon entering.</p>

<p>His companion, sinking into a chair and burying
his face in his hands, groaned aloud.</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. Callister regarded him
gloomily.</p>

<p>Then, extending his hand, he grasped his
shoulder and shook the man with some violence.</p>

<p>"Rube, Rube, I say!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, Lije? Why the deuce can't
you let me be?"</p>

<p>"But there's no use in this kind of business.
What's done is done, and can't be helped. Brace
up man, and try to look as near like yourself as
you can. Here comes Paddy to see what we'll
take."</p>

<p>The burglar raised his head and was staring
fixedly before him, as the half door swung inward
and the sleepy bartender entered the room.</p>

<p>"What's your liquor, gents?" he demanded,
with an air of indifference.</p>

<p>They must pay for their use of the apartment
by an order of some kind.</p>

<p>So that they did this, their presence in the
place, be their business, lawful or unlawful, was
a matter of no moment to him.</p>

<p>"A bottle of Cagney's particular and two
glasses, Paddy, and you may keep the change,"
said Callister, throwing down a five-dollar bill.
"We have a little business to transact together&mdash;don't
let us be disturbed."</p>

<p>"O. K., gents," replied the sleepy bartender,
with a gleam of intelligence in his blinking red
eyes. "I'll look out for yez, and if ye want anything
else, wy jest tap that ere bell."</p>

<p>He presently returned with bottle and glasses
and having placed them upon the table, withdrew.</p>

<p>"Here, Rube, drink this. It will give you
some heart," said the stock operator, pouring out
a portion of the liquor and passing it to his
friend.</p>

<p>The man seized the glass eagerly and drained
it to the last drop.</p>

<p>"My God&mdash;my God! Lije, what a terrible
thing this is!" he exclaimed, in a hoarse whisper,
as he set the glass upon the table again.
"I can see her face before me now, so white and
worn! It will never leave me&mdash;I feel it&mdash;I know
it! It will haunt me as long as I live!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man! You have been guilty of a
piece of tremendous folly, but we've too much at
stake to break all to pieces over such a slip."</p>

<p>"Poor Maria! poor girl!" groaned the man
Rube, again burying his face in his hands and
groaning aloud. "It was all my vile temper,
Lije. I swear to God I never meant to kill her,
and now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And now she's dead," returned Callister,
with an air of hardened indifference. "She was
hopelessly mad, and a nuisance to herself and to
us. She's dead, and it can't be helped. You let
your temper get the better of you, and you killed
her. That's all there is to be said."</p>

<p>"For which act may God forgive me," groaned
Rube again. "Oh, Lije, it seems but yesterday
since I married her! Do you remember what
beautiful girls they were when you and I and
Frank Mansfield went a-courting them? Do you
remember&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I don't remember, and I don't want to.
All the love I had for them was turned to hate
long ago. She's dead, and let her go. What
I'm interested in just now is the whereabouts of
those papers. You thought she had them, and
because she wouldn't give them up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I killed her. God forgive me! I killed her!
Oh, Lije, if I had only listened to Maria's advice,
I'd be a different man to-day from what I am!"</p>

<p>A soft-hearted bank burglar, surely. A strange
murderer, for a fact.</p>

<p>The man had buried his face in his hand again,
which rests upon the table now, and is crying
like a child.</p>

<p>"Rube Tisdale, you are a fool. If you give
way like this, no power on earth can keep you
from being nabbed. You thought Maria had old
Mansfield's will and the paper telling where he
buried his fortune. She refused to give it up,
and you killed her with your fist. We searched
her, and the papers were not to be found. No
one suspects your connection with the woman.
If you will but keep a stiff lip you are as safe in
New York as anywhere else; but if you are going
to give way like this, why the sooner you
skip&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sun, Herald, Journal, World! Papers, gents&mdash;papers!"</p>

<p>A head was thrust through the swinging
door; a ragged boy, carrying a bundle of newspapers
under his arm entered the room.</p>

<p>"Get out, you young imp, or I'll throw this
glass at you!" cried Callister, picking up the
glass and swinging it above his head.</p>

<p>The boy sprang back, the half-door, which
worked on a spring, closing noiselessly after
him.</p>

<p>Then the leading light in the Tenth Baptist
Church turned to the remorse-stricken man
again.</p>

<p>Now, if there was one thing upon which Mr.
Elijah Callister prided himself more than another,
it was upon his shrewdness at all times
and seasons&mdash;no matter how engrossing the
business for the moment occupying his mind.</p>

<p>But if possessed of this quality to any startling
extent, he surely has failed to display it now,
for had he but taken the precaution to open the
half door and look out into the bar-room, he
would have perceived that the sleepy bartender,
yielding to his sleepiness at last, was as firmly
locked in the arms of Morpheus as any of the
drunkards stretched upon the barrels, his head
resting upon his hands, his hands upon the bar.</p>

<p>He might have seen also&mdash;for of this we are
not so certain&mdash;the youthful figure of a ragged
newsboy, crouching in the shadow of a tier of
great whisky-barrels in such a position that,
while he could obtain a view of the feet only of
the two men who occupied Cagney's sanctum beneath
the closed half door, he could, by simply
placing his ear close to the jamb, hear plainly
every word spoken within.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood in the saloon as the conversation
within the sanctum was renewed.</p>

<p>"Rube Tisdale," said the stock operator,
fiercely, "stop this child's business and listen to
me."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm listening."</p>

<p>Though he replied, the man did not raise his
head.</p>

<p>"Our scheme with the Webster Bank has
proved a miserable failure in every particular."</p>

<p>"You don't need to remind me of that."</p>

<p>"But I chose to, and that is enough. First,
all the money we got was five thousand dollars,
for the bonds and securities are utterly useless;
and second, the will of old Mansfield, which I
was most anxious to secure, by your stupidity is
lost, perhaps forever, and the secret of the hiding-place
of a fortune in solid cash is gone with
it, I suppose you understand."</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't my fault. You drew the plans
for the job. You said there was a hundred thousand
in specie in the vault of the bank."</p>

<p>"So there was at noon. How was I to tell
that they would send it all to the Sub-Treasury
in Wall street for security before three o'clock?"</p>

<p>"That's your business. It ain't mine."</p>

<p>"But the Mansfield will and the parchment
telling the hiding-place of the buried treasure&mdash;who
botched that job, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"I took the box of papers you told me about.
I was particular enough to break open the lid to
assure myself that all was right. I had it in my
hand when we heard those infernal bats whistling
in Trinity church-yard. It scared the life
out of us, I want you to understand, for how
were we to know they were bats or what they
were? I must have dropped the box in the snow
as we ran up Broadway."</p>

<p>"And because you happened to see Maria
wandering about, you thought she picked it up,
and killed her, only to find out your mistake.
Well, Rube, upon my life you are a precious
fool. Next time I let you into a scheme like
this I'll know it, I guess."</p>

<p>"Come, you've called me names enough," replied
the burglar, gruffly, raising his head and
facing the man before him. "You are as deep
in the mud as I am in the mire, I want you to
understand. The detectives will turn New York
upside down for this affair. Now, what do you
propose to do? They've got Joe Dutton, and
they've got a part of the swag. It's my opinion
that the best thing we can do is to skip."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Joe is all right. I shall make it
my business to send some one to him at once.
Have no fear, Rube. He'll never blow."</p>

<p>"And the&mdash;the body?"</p>

<p>"We can't do anything about that. Matters
must take their course. I agree with you that
it would be wiser for us to leave town for a
while&mdash;not that I have any serious fears, but
only as a matter of precaution&mdash;but I intend to
have that Mansfield money before I go, make no
mistake about that."</p>

<p>"But how do you propose to get it? Without
the parchment you don't know anything more
about its hiding-place than you did before."</p>

<p>"Rube, it is concealed somewhere about the
old house, I'll be willing to bet all I'm worth.
It was there on the night that&mdash;but no matter
about that&mdash;and I'm sure it is there now. We
never wanted that hidden wealth half as much as
we do now. Frank Mansfield is almost of age;
my scheme to convict him of crime may have
worked and may not. We can't tell into whose
hands the papers may fall. What we want is
the money now."</p>

<p>"All very true, but how are you going to get
it, when you don't know where it is?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to search for it, Rube!" cried Callister
bringing his fist down upon the table with
a bang. "I'm going to search for it, and I'll
find it if I have to tear the old rookery to pieces
bit by bit. Come, we've been here too long already.
Wherever you think yourself the safest,
there hide for the next few days until we see
what comes of this affair. Meanwhile, I'll go
home. To-morrow, at midnight, meet me at the
gate of the Three Oaks, and we'll search for this
hidden treasure as we never searched before.
I've no notion of seeing it drop like a ripe cherry
into the open mouth of that cub of a boy while I
can raise a hand to prevent it."</p>

<p>The pair arose and passed out of the saloon.</p>

<p>The sleeping Paddy did not attract their attention&mdash;they
did not perceive the boy behind the
barrels at all.</p>

<p>Once in the street they separated, the man
Tisdale going down Cherry street, Elijah Callister
up Oliver street to Chatham Square.</p>

<p>He had hardly passed Henry street before a
ragged newsboy went past him on the run.</p>

<p>"Sun&mdash;Herald&mdash;World!" he cried. "Morning
papers! Herald&mdash;Sun&mdash;World&mdash;Journal!"</p>

<p>If Frank Mansfield could have seen the newsboy
then he would have unquestionably recognized
in him Jerry Buck, his companion of the
old church-yard vault.</p>

<p>Had an elephant crossed the path of the
scheming villain, or a dog, or even a mouse, he
might have turned aside and looked upon either
one.</p>

<p>Mr. Elijah Callister, however, paid no attention
to the flying Bat at all.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AN INTRUDER IN THE HOME OF THE BATS.</p>


<p>We left Frank Mansfield standing in company
with Detective Hook before the fence of Trinity
church-yard, beyond which moved the form of
the woman who had tracked his footsteps to the
bank upon the night previous&mdash;of his mother,
whom both he and his companion knew to have
met her death in the upper room of the little
rear house behind the Donegal Shades.</p>

<p>It was for an instant only that the figure faced
them.</p>

<p>Had the warning words spoken behind them
proceeded from those pale, set lips?</p>

<p>Such undoubtedly was the case.</p>

<p>And as if to make the matter still more plain,
even as they gazed upon the apparition through
the palings of the graveyard fence, the words
were repeated again.</p>

<p>"Again I say to you, my son, seek not the
parchment. Watch and wait, for the day of
vengeance is at hand."</p>

<p>Suddenly the figure of the woman had come
to a halt.</p>

<p>Raising one thin hand aloft to the starlit sky
above, these words escaped her lips.</p>

<p>Then advancing with a gliding movement
among the crumbling stones of the old burial
ground, the outline of her form seemed to fade
away in the darkness, to mingle with the shadows
of the great church, of the snow-capped
tombs.</p>

<p>It was all the work of an instant. Not half
the time was consumed in the happening that
has elapsed in telling the tale.</p>

<p>As though animated by a common thought,
the detective and young Frank Mansfield had
leaped toward the church-yard wall.</p>

<p>The fence offered no obstacle.</p>

<p>They dropped in the snow among the headstones.</p>

<p>"After her, boy!" whispered Hook. "After
her without an instant's delay; there's some
crooked work going on here, and it will go hard
with some one, but I'll find out what it is."</p>

<p>But Frank Mansfield did not heed him.</p>

<p>He no more believed in ghosts than did Caleb
Hook.</p>

<p>If the woman by the side of whose dead body
he had knelt in the house on Catherine street
had been his poor, insane mother, driven mad
by such a combination of afflictions as woman
is seldom called upon to bear, then who was this?</p>

<p>He needed no encouragement from the man
by his side to spur him on to solve the mystery
for himself.</p>

<p>The day had been clear and more than unusually
warm, causing the snow to soften considerably,
but as night had approached the thermometer
had fallen, forming a hard crust upon the
smooth surface among the stones.</p>

<p>With a bound Frank reached the point in the
church-yard at which the apparition had appeared,
Detective Hook pressing close behind.</p>

<p>It was unoccupied by human form.</p>

<p>The headstones were there, the shadows of
the church were there, the leafless branches of
the great trees rattled gloomily above their
heads.</p>

<p>But the woman whose warning words had fallen
so plainly upon their ears was nowhere to be
seen.</p>

<p>She had disappeared&mdash;disappeared, leaving no
trace behind.</p>

<p>There was not so much as the outline of her
footsteps to be seen upon the hardened crust of
the snow.</p>

<p>"Come," whispered Hook, "this is the way
she went, over toward the New Church street
wall. She cannot get out; there are but two
gates, and both are locked at night; it is twenty
feet to the ground on the side towards which she
disappeared, to say nothing of the fence she
would have to climb."</p>

<p>They picked their way among the tombs to the
rear of the church.</p>

<p>Here, in the cold starlight, the entire expanse
of the church-yard was plainly visible from the
fence on the Rector street side to the wall of the
great Trinity Building at the upper end.</p>

<p>Not the faintest trace of the woman could be
seen.</p>

<p>Footsteps there were in abundance, but the
hardened crust had formed over them, showing
plainly that they were the footsteps of persons
who had passed over the snow some time before.</p>

<p>As it was Sunday, and service had been held
in the Trinity Church twice at least during the
day, there was nothing strange in this.</p>

<p>A score of people might have amused themselves
wandering about among the moldering
tombs, as the church-yard is free to all.</p>

<p>Detective Hook examined these footprints
carefully.</p>

<p>Among them he recognized his own and those
measured by him the night before.</p>

<p>At one point he observed also many smaller
than the rest, as though made by the feet of
boys; and these were particularly numerous in
the vicinity of a great flat tomb-stone, embedded
apparently in the solid earth, about which the
snow had all been cleared away.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hook," whispered Frank, nervously,
"what can this mean?"</p>

<p>"My boy, you have me there. I can't tell any
more than yourself."</p>

<p>"It is very, very strange. I saw my mother
as plainly as I see you now. I heard her words
spoken in her own voice."</p>

<p>"You are positive that it was your mother,
Frank?" said the detective, musingly, as he stood
contemplating the great flat stone.</p>

<p>"Positive? Of course I am. It is almost
enough to make me feel that I am going mad myself.
I should doubt my own vision, my hearing
even, had you not both seen and heard too."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to doubt," replied Hook
with sudden emphasis, turning his gaze at the
same time upon the boy, who stood trembling
with excitement before him.</p>

<p>"What you saw I saw, what you heard was
heard also by me. No, no, my boy, there is no
madness in this case. If you are positive that
the woman murdered in Catherine street was
your mother, that the woman I followed through
the streets last night was your mother, then, although
I am an utter disbeliever in spiritual
manifestations of all kinds, I see but one conclusion
to draw&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>As the detective paused, staring about the
church-yard in deep perplexity, Frank felt a
shudder pass through his frame from his head to
his feet.</p>

<p>If the man by his side did not believe in ghosts,
no more did he.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, the woman seen by them both was gone,
and that was all there was to it.</p>

<p>The whole expanse of the rear of the Trinity
church-yard, toward which she had moved, now
lay spread out before them.</p>

<p>If her gliding figure had vanished into thin air
it could not have disappeared more effectually
than it had.</p>

<p>"Come," said Hook, abruptly moving at the
same time toward the low wall on the Rector
street side, "there's no use in remaining
longer; we shall learn nothing here to-night."</p>

<p>Gaining the fence, he vaulted lightly to the
street.</p>

<p>Frank, following his example, stood by his
side.</p>

<p>"Well, which way are you going?" asked the
detective. "I am tired, and off for home."</p>

<p>"Oh, I stay with some friends to-night."</p>

<p>"Friends! What friends? Be careful. If we
are going to work together, you must follow my
instructions to the letter. Are you sure of these
friends of yours? Won't they give you away?"</p>

<p>"I have no fear of that," replied the boy,
quietly. "I've had some experience with treacherous
friends. I know that I can depend on
these."</p>

<p>"Very well. Go to them, then, and meet me&mdash;let
me see&mdash;you can meet me to-morrow at my
house at four o'clock, if you don't see me before
that time. Meanwhile, I'll keep this box and
these papers, including your grandfather's will.
We'll lay out a regular course of action together
next time we meet. If we only had that parchment,
the way would be plain; but it seems that
we are obliged to follow the advice we have received
so strangely to-night, whether we want to
or not&mdash;to watch and wait."</p>

<p>Pressing Frank warmly by the hand, Caleb
Hook turned abruptly and walked off up Broadway.</p>

<p>He did not look behind him, nor even turn his
head.</p>

<p>Passing Trinity Church and the grave-yard beyond,
his form was presently lost to view among
the high buildings which line either side of the
street.</p>

<p>And not until then did Frank Mansfield move
from the place where the detective had left him,
but remained leaning against the iron fence at
the corner of Rector street and Broadway.</p>

<p>No sooner had Caleb Hook disappeared, than
he turned, and keeping close within the shadow
of the wall, moved down Rector street in the
direction of New Church.</p>

<p>As he passed opposite the Webster Bank he
turned and gazed upon it with feelings of
mingled shame and an utter despisal of himself.</p>

<p>If he had had no hand in the robbery, he had
at least been ready to betray the secrets of those
who had trusted him for hope of paltry gain.</p>

<p>Within the banking-room lights were burning,
and the boy could see his fellow clerks poring
over books and papers in the endeavor to discover
the extent of the bank's loss before opening
for business next day.</p>

<p>Deeply depressed, and with a sense of utter
self-contempt strong upon him, Frank slunk by
those lighted windows, and turning the corner
of New Church street, still keeping close to the
grave-yard wall, paused before the great iron
door.</p>

<p>Leaning against it, he cast a hasty glance up
and down.</p>

<p>The street was deserted. Not a soul was anywhere
visible.</p>

<p>But stay!</p>

<p>It might have been fancy, but as he looked a
second time it seemed to the boy, in his excited
state of mind, that a woman's form at that moment
turned the corner of Rector street upon the
opposite side of the way and disappeared from
view.</p>

<p>Darting to the corner at the top of his speed,
he swept the short street at one glance.</p>

<p>That he had been mistaken was evident.</p>

<p>From Broadway above to the river front below
not a living thing was to be seen.</p>

<p>"If this thing keeps up I shall go mad myself,"
he muttered, brokenly. "I see my dead
mother now at every turn."</p>

<p>Pausing once more in front of the iron door in
the church-yard wall, he gave utterance to a peculiar
bat-like cry.</p>

<p>Presently, as though from a great distance, the
cry was repeated.</p>

<p>Whether from above or below no one could
have told.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seemed as much as anywhere to
come from out of the wall itself.</p>

<p>Frank remained silently waiting.</p>

<p>Presently the great iron door swung slowly
back, and a boy's head appeared in the opening.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Frank Mansfield?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Is that you, Jerry Buck?"</p>

<p>"Slide in, young feller," said the boy, in a
whisper. "I'm a-scart to hold the door open
long. After all that happened last night I'm expecting
every minute that some one will catch
onto our hole in the wall."</p>

<p>His sentence was completed within the old
tomb itself, for Frank had entered at the first
word, the door being closed behind him and securely
barred.</p>

<p>"Come up to the den," said Jerry, leading the
way up the steps. "Most of the fellers is in to-night
and are abed long ago. I know'd you'd keep
your promise and come, so me and Barney sat
up to let you in."</p>

<p>Entering the inner apartment of the tomb,
Frank found that the boy had spoken the truth.</p>

<p>Barney the boot-black sat smoking a clay
pipe by the side of the table, upon which was
a loaf of bread and a mug.</p>

<p>"Hello! I know'd you'd come!" said the bootblack,
springing up. "Have you had your supper?
I kept some in case you didn't."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I've had all I want," replied
Frank, sinking wearily upon an old stool. "I'm
tremendously obliged to you fellows for your
kindness to me. Mebbe I shall be able to return
it some of these days."</p>

<p>"That's all right," put in Jerry Buck. "If I
can help any friend of Barney's, I'm glad to do
it."</p>

<p>"Hush!" cried Barney, holding up his finger
warningly as Frank was about to reply. "Jerry,
as true as I live there's some one up above.
I didn't hear no signal, did you?"</p>

<p>The three boys stood motionless.</p>

<p>Above their heads, at the top of the ladder,
down which Frank had seen the two boys descend
upon the occasion of his first visit to the
tomb, a grating sound was heard&mdash;such a sound
as might be made by the rising of a tightly-fitting
trap-door.</p>

<p>At the same instant two feet were seen upon
the top round of the ladder, which, descending,
were followed by the legs and body of a man.</p>

<p>"Twigged at last, by thunder!" exclaimed
Jerry Buck, uttering a warning cry, which had
the effect of instantly arousing several sleeping
boyish forms stretched upon pieces of old carpet
at various angles upon the floor.</p>

<p>At the same instant a man sprang from the
ladder and stood in their midst.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, boys," he said, quietly. "So
this is where you hang out? Upon my word,
now, it ain't half a bad place. I've slept in many
a worse one myself."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CALEB HOOK MAKES HIMSELF AT HOME.</p>


<p>The boys stared at the man who had leaped
among them from off the ladder with feelings of
alarmed surprise.</p>

<p>Nor was the surprise of Frank Mansfield less
than the others.</p>

<p>It was Detective Hook who stood before him&mdash;Detective
Hook, whom he had supposed to be
already far upon his homeward way.</p>

<p>"So these are your friends?" he said, quietly,
as the boys gathered about him, with faces expressive
of anything but welcome. "I rather
thought I should tumble on something like this.
Introduce me, Frank. It will take off the awkwardness
a bit."</p>

<p>"Oh, we don't want to know you, boss,"
spoke up one of the boys, with a threatening
air. "We don't allow no visitors, we don't, and
we're going to show yer, too, blame quick."</p>

<p>"Yes," growled Garibaldi, the Italian boy,
"disa whata coma from taka in de stranger
among us."</p>

<p>As for Jerry Buck, Barney the bootblack, and
Frank himself, they stared at one another, the
two Bats surveying the boy whom they had befriended
with angry looks, Frank regarding them
with a face upon which was seen plainly imprinted
every evidence of innocent surprise.</p>

<p>He did not dare to offend the detective, who
could, as he was well aware, throw him into the
hands of the law at any moment. He felt both
sorry and ashamed to think that the kind-hearted
boys who had befriended him in his trouble
should for a moment think that he had betrayed
their hiding-place to a member of the police.</p>

<p>"Is this feller a friend of yourn?" demanded
Barney, in no pleasant tone.</p>

<p>"It is Detective Hook, boys," replied Frank,
with as much firmness as he could muster. "I
swear to you all that I never breathed a word."</p>

<p>"I knowed it," muttered Jerry beneath his
breath.</p>

<p>But Caleb Hook, with a keen realization of
the way matters stood, gave no opportunity for
further words.</p>

<p>He had suspected the existence of just such a
place as this from the first moment of Frank's
mysterious disappearance on the previous night.</p>

<p>Now, it was a life rule of this remarkable man
that no suspicion worthy of entertaining at all
should be abandoned until either its truth or its
falsity had been proved.</p>

<p>It was for that reason he had chosen for his
meeting with this boy, in whose strange case he
was becoming hourly more interested, the time
and place he had.</p>

<p>"Hold on, boys," he said, a broad smile breaking
over his face, "before you fire me out of
here, before that little Italian sticks a tooth-pick
into me or you condemn Frank Mansfield for a
traitor, hear what the detective has got to say."</p>

<p>"Well, say on, den, blame quick!" exclaimed
Sandy the Bat, who had first spoken, "for we
fellers is a-goin' to pound the life outer yer in
jest about a minit and a half."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Well, I'm not afraid. In the first
place I swear now, without being asked, never to
give this place away, provided I catch none of
you boys transgressing the law. Second, I tell
you now, and tell you the truth when I say it,
that this young man, Frank Mansfield, never by
so much as a word told me anything about this
place, any boy here present, or gave me the
slightest clew how to enter it as I did."</p>

<p>All the boys stared at the detective in surprise.</p>

<p>"I knowed it," growled Jerry Buck again.
"How could Frank Mansfield tell him about the
up-stairs way, fellers, when he didn't know
nothing about it himself?"</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want with us, anyhow?"
asked Barney, with a somewhat mollified air.
"We're only a lot of poor kids as hasn't got no
better place to tie up in winter-time nor this.
We don't do no one any harm."</p>

<p>"I know that," answered Hook, pleasantly,
"and that's why I propose to let you alone. I
found the entrance beneath the flat tombstone in
the church-yard entirely by itself. If you wished
to conceal it you were foolish to clear the snow
away. But you need have no fears of me, not
one of you. All I want now is that you answer
me a few questions, and then I'll be off about
my business and forget that I was ever here."</p>

<p>"Well, that depends upon de questions," replied
Barney, taking upon himself the duty of
spokesman. "Maybe we'll answer and maybe
we won't."</p>

<p>"They concern Frank Mansfield only and
can't harm you."</p>

<p>"Fire away, den," said Barney, shortly.</p>

<p>Frank, meanwhile, maintained a discreet
silence.</p>

<p>It was plainly evident that nothing he could
say or do would help matters at all.</p>

<p>"Who was the woman that passed through
here just now by the way I came in?"</p>

<p>The detective had seated himself carelessly
upon the table, with one foot resting upon the
ground.</p>

<p>As he propounded the question he coolly
lighted a cigar, and passed one to each of the
boys.</p>

<p>"I don't know wot yer mean," replied Barney,
with some slight evidence of embarrassment.
"Dere's no woman comes in here, is dere,
Jerry?"</p>

<p>"Not much!" said Jerry, shortly, as he produced
matches and lit his cigar.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll try again. Which of you boys
found the box last night?"</p>

<p>He held up the tin box of papers handed him
by Frank Mansfield a short time before.</p>

<p>"I found it first. And I gave it to Barney to
take care of," replied Jerry. "I picked it up on
Rector street, right in front of the bank, after I
see'd the burglars run."</p>

<p>"Oh, you saw the burglars, did you? By the
way, you are the newspaper boy that was with
Frank at the Catherine Market this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Jerry Buck."</p>

<p>"How did you come to see these fellows?"</p>

<p>"Why, I was coming down Rector street on
my way here just as they were comin' out of the
bank."</p>

<p>"Did they see you?"</p>

<p>"Not much," replied the boy, laughing and
showing his teeth. "I'm too fly for that, mister.
I hid in the shadow of the wall, and give
them the bat call. Gosh! you orter seen them
run! There was three of 'em&mdash;one had a big
bag, another a carpet sack. It was the big
feller wot dropped that box."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by the 'bat call?'"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to say nothin' 'bout that," answered
Jerry, hesitatingly, seeing that the Bats
were regarding him with no pleasant eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," said the detective, indifferently.
"I don't want to pry into your secrets,
boys. All I want is to bring these bank
robbers to justice, and remove suspicion from our
young friend here. That's my business here to-night,
and I've nothing to do with any other
matters at all. I suppose you are all friends of
his, or he wouldn't be among you. By the way,
that was a mighty sharp trick, getting him away
from the officer who had him in charge last
night."</p>

<p>"Oh, we're fly every time, boss," replied Barney,
with an air of conscious pride. "You can
just bet your life on that."</p>

<p>Caleb Hook laughed pleasantly, and took an
extra puff at his cigar.</p>

<p>"Frank, here's one witness to prove that you
didn't rob the bank," he said, pointing carelessly
to Jerry Buck.</p>

<p>"An' here's anoder," put in Barney. "I seen
the fellers too."</p>

<p>"I'm sure both of them will testify to what
they know, Mr. Hook," said Frank, somewhat
puzzled to discern the detective's aim.</p>

<p>"Of course we will," exclaimed Barney. "Me
an' Jerry has undertook to set you right, and
we're de kind as goes de whole hog or none."</p>

<p>The reply came heartily, nor was the assent of
Jerry Buck any less strong.</p>

<p>It seemed strange that these wild street Arabs
had taken up his cause in the manner they had.</p>

<p>Strange to Caleb Hook as he sat scanning the
faces of the "bats" about him. Doubly strange
to Frank himself the more he turned it over in
his mind.</p>

<p>But his situation was such that there was nothing
for it but to drift helplessly with the tide,
with Detective Hook for his rudder, to steer him
to whatever haven of safety he might choose.</p>

<p>And the boy did well to place his reliance
where he did.</p>

<p>Had he searched New York from end to end,
he could not have found a shrewder ally or a better
man.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the detective. "The testimony
of two is better than that of one. Would
either of you know the three men again?"</p>

<p>"Every one on 'em," said Jerry, decidedly.</p>

<p>"Good again. You saw the man over whom
I tumbled in Catherine street this morning,
when I tried to catch hold of your coat. Was he
one of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he was, boss, an' a minute after another&mdash;the
big feller wot dropped the box&mdash;went up
the street."</p>

<p>"He did?"</p>

<p>"Sure's yer born. I know'd him the minute I
saw him."</p>

<p>"I saw him, too, Mr. Hook," said Frank,
eagerly, "and with him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment," said the detective, throwing
a warning look toward Frank. "I'm listening
to Jerry now. You can tell your story by and
by. Where did the man go, Jerry? Do you
know?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the newsboy, shaking his head.
"I went down to the house where the woman
was murdered. You seen me there, you know."</p>

<p>This, of course, was true.</p>

<p>And yet the reader knows, as well as did Jerry
Buck himself, that it was far, very far, from
being the whole truth.</p>

<p>Of his subsequent adventures in Cagney's
sanctum, of the conversation he had overheard
while crouched behind the whisky barrels outside
the half door, he said nothing at all.</p>

<p>Nor did he mention the little fact&mdash;and this the
reader does not know&mdash;of his having followed
the respectable Mr. Elijah Callister to the very
door of his Fifth avenue mansion before allowing
him to pass from before his eyes.</p>

<p>For reasons best known to himself Jerry Buck
was silent in all these points, neither Frank nor
the detective, as a matter of course, dreaming of
the knowledge he thus held in reserve.</p>

<p>But whatever had been the motive of Caleb
Hook in thus penetrating the retreat of the Bats
in the Wall&mdash;the entrance to which let us say
right here, his keen eyes had detected from the
suspicious circumstances of the snow being
cleared away around the great flat tombstone by
the side of which he had come to a halt, when
in company with Frank he had followed the
strange apparition through the Trinity church-yard&mdash;whatever
had been his motive, we repeat,
it was evident that he had satisfied it now, for he
leaped from the table and moved toward the
foot of the ladder leading to the church-yard
above.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, boys," he exclaimed, as
carelessly as though his unexpected visit had
been an every-day affair. "I'll call upon you
fellows when I want your testimony. Never
mind opening the door; I can raise the stone
myself. Frank Mansfield, I want you. Come
along with me."</p>

<p>He sprang up the ladder, Frank following him.</p>

<p>Completely carried away by the manner of the
man, not one of the Bats even thought of interfering.</p>

<p>The flat tombstone was raised and lowered as
they passed out.</p>

<p>It was of sandstone, much decayed, and only a
light affair, after all.</p>

<p>What Caleb Hook had to say to Frank as they
once more vaulted the fence, this time walking
up Broadway together, we do not know, but it
is a fact that the boy, who, had he fallen into the
hands of a detective of the average density of
skull, would at that moment, in all probability
have been an inmate of the Tombs, spent the
short remainder of the night upon a lounge in
Detective Hook's own room, as comfortably as
you pleased.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE THREE OAKS.</p>


<p>The Three Oaks was haunted.</p>

<p>At least every one said so, and what every one
says is supposed to be true.</p>

<p>To be sure, it would have been difficult to have
found any person who had actually seen the
ghost.</p>

<p>Nor was this necessary.</p>

<p>Strange lights moving about the old house at
night, flitting from window to window, from the
great parlor panes upon the first floor to the little
diamond-shaped panes up under the roof, had
been seen by the passers-by on the Fort Washington
road at night, over and over again, and
was quite enough for the neighbors who dwelt
outside its crumbling walls.</p>

<p>But what was Three Oaks and where was it?</p>

<p>These are both proper questions, and should
be answered at once.</p>

<p>Three Oaks was a house, and an old one at
that. It still stands to-day on the road mentioned
above, which is, as every one knows, in
the north-west corner of Manhattan Island, and
extends from the little village whose name it
bears to the 155th street station of the elevated
road.</p>

<p>It was a large house and an old house; it
stood in the center of a thick growth of oaks,
surrounded by a stretch of uncultivated ground,
and divided from the road by a high stone wall.</p>

<p>A more gloomy, desolate-looking old rookery
it would have been difficult to have found. And
yet Three Oaks had been a handsome place in
its day.</p>

<p>But that day had long since passed.</p>

<p>For ten years, at least, old Jeremiah Mansfield,
its former owner had lived there alone. It
was five years since he had been found murdered
in his bed.</p>

<p>This was the work of burglars.</p>

<p>They had broken into the old house in the
night, in the hope of obtaining a large sum in
money, of which the strange old man, little better
than a miser, was supposed to be possessed.</p>

<p>Whether they had succeeded in finding it no
one ever knew.</p>

<p>The burglars were not caught&mdash;the dead lips
of the murdered man never told the tale.</p>

<p>From that night Three Oaks had remained deserted,
and was fast sinking to ruin and decay.</p>

<p>To whom it belonged few in the neighborhood
could have told, but every one had seen the
lights&mdash;seen them not only once, but again and
again. And who but the ghost of old Miser
Mansfield himself would think of prowling about
the dust-laden rooms of Three Oaks at midnight?</p>

<p>That was precisely what the neighbors wanted
to know.</p>

<p>You could not have hired one of them to have
approached the old house after dark.</p>

<p>Indeed, some timid persons objected even to
passing it on the public road after the shades of
night had begun to fall.</p>

<p>Upon the evening of the day following the
events of the last few chapters, at a little before
midnight, a solitary pedestrian might have been
observed picking his way gingerly along the
Fort Washington road, opposite the moldering
stone wall surrounding Three Oaks, sheltering
himself beneath a large alpaca umbrella from the
rain which all day long had been falling in torrents,
rendering the snow of two days before a
slushy mass beneath the feet.</p>

<p>Might have been observed, did we say?</p>

<p>The qualification was well put.</p>

<p>Surely no one save a person whose errand was
most pressing would venture out in a spot so
lonely upon a night like this.</p>

<p>The wind whirling down the road from the
Hudson and the heights of the Palisades beyond
played with the alpaca umbrella as with some
child's toy, the rain coming down in what appeared
in the darkness an almost unbroken
sheet, has drenched the clothes of this unfortunate
traveler as to make them cling like so many
plasters to his body.</p>

<p>Indeed, so utterly saturated has he become,
that it seems a matter of wonder that he does
not abandon the umbrella altogether and boldly
face the storm.</p>

<p>Slump! Slump! Slump!</p>

<p>As he raises one foot from the pasty, dripping
mass of melting snow the other sinks through it
to the very stones of the road beneath.</p>

<p>As he approached the broken gate leading up
to the clump of oaks behind which the dark outlines
of the old Mansfield house could be dimly
seen, the man paused, leaned for a moment
against the dripping wall, and gave utterance to
a single word:</p>

<p>"Rube!"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"He has not come," muttered the man, impatiently.
"Can anything have happened? Rube
is generally punctual. Perhaps the wind sighing
through those gloomy old oaks has deadened
the sound of my voice."</p>

<p>Again he called more distinctly than before:</p>

<p>"Rube! Rube!"</p>

<p>At the same instant from out of the clump of
oaks a man's form appeared.</p>

<p>"All right. Come on," a voice was heard to
say.</p>

<p>Pushing up the avenue leading to the mansion,
which now more nearly resembled a rushing
river than the smooth graveled road its
builder had intended, he of the umbrella joined
the man from among the trees, and both ascending
the steps of the piazza, stood before the
door of Three Oaks, sheltered from the storm at
last.</p>

<p>"Pah! what a beast of a night!" exclaimed
the owner of the alpaca umbrella, petulantly,
shaking the water from his garments and closing
it with a vicious snap. "I've had Satan's own
time getting here, Rube. But it's just the night
for our work. No fear of interruption from any
inquisitive neighbors in a storm like this."</p>

<p>"You are right, Lije," replied the other,
striking a match upon his trousers and touching
it to a cigar. "But somehow I wish we had
chosen any other night myself. It reminds one
of the night the old man pegged out. You remember&mdash;it
rained harder even than this."</p>

<p>Dim as is the light of the match, it is sufficient
to show us the faces of these midnight visitors to
old Jeremiah Mansfield's former home.</p>

<p>It is Mr. Elijah Callister who grasps the alpaca
umbrella, it is his friend the bank burglar who
now puffs away at the cigar&mdash;Reuben Tisdale
by name.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word, if you ain't the greatest
fellow to bring up unpleasant memories I ever
saw," exclaimed the stock-broker, crossly, as he
produced a large key from his pocket, and inserting
it in the rusty lock, threw open the hall
door. "Why the mischief can't you let sleeping
dogs lie? No man wants to be reminded of his
past sins."</p>

<p>"I need no reminding of mine, Lije," replied
the man gloomily, as the door was closed behind
him and the broker proceeded to light a lantern,
which he took with apparent familiarity from one
corner of the carpetless hall. "They are before
me night and day. If I had the courage I'd kill
myself, but I have no more than a mouse. I'm a
doomed man, Lije Callister, I feel it more and
more, but being past redemption must go on sinning
to the end."</p>

<p>"Well, if you ain't positively the worst," exclaimed
Callister, impatiently. "What ails
you?"</p>

<p>"I should think enough ailed me. With poor
Maria's blood upon my hands calling for vengeance&mdash;ain't
that enough?"</p>

<p>"You ought to have thought of that before
you struck her. What's done is done. Be your
old self, Rube. We are likely to want all our
courage before this bank affair quiets down."</p>

<p>"What's the latest, Lije?" asked Tisdale, in a
low tone, and with some expression of anxiety.
"I have not seen a paper to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, you may speak as loud as you wish," replied
Callister, taking off the top of the lantern,
and picking up the wick with a pin. "There's
no one within a quarter of a mile of us. There's
no special news other than what you know, except
so far as concerns Frank Mansfield."</p>

<p>"And what of him? Did the plan of Billy
Cutts succeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and no. Frank was arrested just as he
was entering the bank, but on the way to the
police station he managed to escape."</p>

<p>"The deuce! How was that?"</p>

<p>"No one seems to know. I sent a party to interview
the detective who arrested him&mdash;a fellow
by the name of Hook&mdash;but could only learn that
somewhere in the neighborhood of the wall of
Trinity church-yard he managed to give the officer
the slip."</p>

<p>"Was he handcuffed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, so I understand."</p>

<p>"And has not been caught since?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That is most mysterious."</p>

<p>"So I say."</p>

<p>"What do they say about the bank robbery?"</p>

<p>"They all believe Frank was in the job, of
course. The bank has offered a reward of a
thousand dollars for his arrest."</p>

<p>"And what about Joe Dutton?"</p>

<p>"He was sent to the Tombs this morning.
My party saw him, and he swears by all that's
holy he'll die before he gives us away by so much
as a word."</p>

<p>"He'd better," muttered Tisdale, fiercely.
"He'll be a dead Joe if he attempts to speak&mdash;don't
let him forget that."</p>

<p>"That's all very true, Rube," replied the
stock broker, "but all the same his arrest is
mighty bad for us. He's the first of our gang
who ever fell into the hands of the law. When
one goes, all goes&mdash;that's the old saying, you
know."</p>

<p>"Then so much the more reason why we
should succeed to-night. I tell you, Lije, as I
told you yesterday. It would be healthier for us
to leave town for awhile."</p>

<p>"Yes, or to put Joe Dutton where he can't
do us any harm," replied Callister, in a fierce
whisper.</p>

<p>"What! you wouldn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I? Well, never mind. Let's attend
to the business we have in hand. Rube,
old Mansfield's money is in this house. You
know how the will reads. If Frank can be convicted
of crime before he is old enough to inherit,
which will now be in a very short time, the
money comes to me in a regular course, and the
parchment containing the secret of its hiding-place
would have been delivered into my hand."</p>

<p>"Exactly. And not satisfied with the job you
put upon the boy, you must rope me into a bank
robbery, where all we get is five thousand for
our pains. You must have that parchment, and
this is the result."</p>

<p>"The result would have been quite different
if you had managed to hold on to it instead of
dropping it in the street," replied Callister,
crossly. "That's where the folly comes in. But
come, we've wasted time enough in talking.
Let us go up-stairs to the old man's chamber. I've
an idea that the treasure is hidden somewhere
about the hearth."</p>

<p>He picked up the lantern and began to ascend
the broad staircase leading to the rooms above.</p>

<p>"So you've thought twenty times before, but
could never find it," growled Tisdale, following.
"Didn't you examine this blessed old rookery
from garret to cellar, not over a year ago?"</p>

<p>They ascended the stairs, and entered a large
room at the rear of the house upon the floor
above.</p>

<p>Ruin and desolation met their gaze wherever
the feeble rays of the lantern fell.</p>

<p>Filled with rich and costly furniture, adorned
with pictures, expensive cabinets, and rich hangings
about the windows and doors, the chamber&mdash;once
that of the master of the mansion&mdash;was a
forcible illustration of the truth of that memorable
warning against riches.</p>

<p>Upon earth Jeremiah Mansfield had heaped up
treasures.</p>

<p>Moth and rust had corrupted&mdash;thieves had
broken in to steal.</p>

<p>The rich carpet, the elegant hangings were
worn and faded, the costly furniture heaped up
in the corners rotting with dampness and decay.</p>

<p>From one side of the wall a large strip of heavy
gilt had fallen away, green with mold, displaying
the discolored plaster behind, dust covered
the picture frames, the floor, the ceiling&mdash;in fact,
everything in and about the room, and more
than all the bedstead upon which the old miser
had met his end.</p>

<p>This cumbrous piece of mahogany, tilted forward
into the room, from the lapse of one decaying
leg, was a dust heap in itself.</p>

<p>Tisdale looked about him shudderingly.</p>

<p>"Lije, it's enough to give a man the horrors!"
he mutteringly said.</p>

<p>But the stock broker made no reply.</p>

<p>That he was in this chilling apartment for
work, not talk, was evident from every motion
he made.</p>

<p>Throwing aside his coat and hat, he placed the
lantern by the side of the fire-place, and with a
hammer and cold chisel, taken from the pockets
of his overcoat, began to remove its back, brick
by brick.</p>

<p>"Hold the lantern, Rube," he whispered, as
he struck upon the back of the fire-place with
the hammer. "There is a hollow space back of
this&mdash;don't you hear? I tell you, man, we've
struck it at last!"</p>

<p>Tisdale seized the lantern and stooped forward
toward the fire-place, Callister ringing blow after
blow upon the chisel, and prying out the bricks
right and left.</p>

<p>Suddenly the whole back of the fire-place fell
inward with a crash, raising a cloud of dust
which nearly blinded them both.</p>

<p>Seizing the lantern from the hand of his companion,
the broker thrust his head into the space
revealed, a hollow in the chimney, large enough
to hold a million in gold.</p>

<p>It was empty!</p>

<p>Save for the broken bricks and bits of mortar,
the rays of the lantern shone upon empty space
alone.</p>

<p>With a smothered curse, Elijah Callister drew
back into the room.</p>

<p>"Fooled again!" he muttered, fiercely. "If
the builders of this infernal den had constructed
that place on purpose to raise my hopes, they
could not have succeeded better. We'll have to
try again."</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left his lips, when from
the gloom behind them a strange sound fell upon
their ears.</p>

<p>It was half-sigh&mdash;half-groan.</p>

<p>It seemed to come from behind the bed.</p>

<p>"My God! Lije, did you hear that?" exclaimed
Tisdale, in a hoarse whisper, seizing
his companion by the arm.</p>

<p>At the same instant from behind the bed there
emerged the form of a woman, tall and thin,
with pinched features, wild, restless eyes, and
long gray hair hanging down her neck and
shoulders.</p>

<p>Coarse, worn garments hung loosely about her,
a cheap shawl was thrown carelessly about the
shoulders and pinned across her breast.</p>

<p>With one long, white finger extended before
her, she advanced slowly toward the villainous
pair without uttering a word.</p>

<p>Could Frank Mansfield have seen her, he would
have instantly recognized the mother whose
death he mourned.</p>

<p>Could Detective Hook have seen her, not for
one instant could he have doubted that Mrs. Marley,
whose dead body he had raised with his own
hands from the floor of that wretched upper
chamber in the rear of the Donegal Shades, and
this woman were one and the same.</p>

<p>With a cry of horror Reuben Tisdale sprang
backward toward the fire-place.</p>

<p>"Keep back, woman!" he yelled, his eyes
starting from his head in terror. "God have
mercy! 'Tis the spirit of my murdered wife!"</p>

<p>With a deep sigh the specter, with a gliding
motion, moved backward, disappearing in the
gloom beyond.</p>

<p>And even as the last glimpse of her shadowy
form had disappeared from the gaze of Elijah
Callister, who, with whitened face, stood still,
grasping the lantern in his hand, his companion
fell forward with a deep groan, motionless upon
the floor.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">AN ADVERTISEMENT.</p>


<p>When Frank Mansfield awoke next morning
he found Detective Hook standing by his side.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was the pressure of the detective's
hand upon his forehead that had called him from
sleep.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, my boy," he said, pleasantly.
"It's time you were stirring, if you intend taking
breakfast with me."</p>

<p>Frank sprang off of the lounge and began putting
on his clothes.</p>

<p>"I could sleep all day, I think," he said, rubbing
his eyes. "I never felt so sleepy in my life."</p>

<p>"No wonder, after the strain you have been
under for the last forty-eight hours. That was
one reason why I insisted upon your coming
home with me. I want you to get thoroughly
rested and refreshed; then you will be able to
show what you are made of in working out our
scheme. That hole in the wall may do well
enough for newsboys and bootblacks, but it is no
place for a boy like you."</p>

<p>"It served me a good turn the other night, all
the same."</p>

<p>"I don't dispute that. By the way, how did
you manage to get into the vault that night?
Through the iron door on the New Church street
side?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was the way."</p>

<p>"I thought as much. I took a good look at
the place and its surroundings before I entered.
I thought I had sized it up pretty well."</p>

<p>"But how did you come to guess the entrance
lay beneath that particular tombstone?" asked
Frank, stooping to tie his shoes. "I didn't
know myself where it was, although I knew there
was some way of getting in from above."</p>

<p>The detective smiled.</p>

<p>"If I told you all I knew," he replied, pleasantly,
"why, then you'd know as much as I do
myself, and would have no further use for my
services. No, no, young man, I am working for
money. Under the will of your grandfather you
are justly entitled to a large fortune, which
through your own folly and the machinations of
that man Callister has come mighty near slipping
through your hands, if it has not already
done so. My work now is to help you to the recovery
of this fortune. Once you are in possession
of it, I shall expect to be paid. Then ask
me for my secrets, and I may tell you; meanwhile,
we will see what kind of a breakfast my
landlady has sent us up this morning, talk matters
over together, and decide what is the first
step to take."</p>

<p>He led the way into the room immediately behind
the sleeping chamber, where a comfortable
breakfast for two was already spread.</p>

<p>"I prefer to take my meals in private," said
the detective, proceeding to help Frank to beefsteak,
rolls, coffee and eggs. "It avoids all
gossip among the boarders as to my movements
and enables me to come and go as I please
without exciting comment from any one, which
is just the sort of an arrangement I need. Make
yourself at home; if you don't see what you
want, ask for it. There are the morning papers
for you if you want to read."</p>

<p>Frank appropriated one paper, the detective
taking another.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck the boy's eye was a
full account of the robbery of the Webster Bank
and the reward offered by the bank officials for
his own arrest.</p>

<p>And over his mind there crept a feeling of renewed
shame for the wretched position into
which he had been led by his own folly.</p>

<p>He inwardly resolved that once out of this
scrape&mdash;once clear before the world&mdash;that never,
so long as he lived, should a drop of liquor pass
his lips again.</p>

<p>"The papers seem to be making quite a stir
about you, don't they?" said the detective, laying
down the one he had been reading, and plying
his knife and fork. "Wouldn't there be a
fine kick-up if they knew I had you concealed
here?"</p>

<p>"I suppose there would. I am entirely in your
power, Mr. Hook. You can handle me as you
please."</p>

<p>"Don't say power, Frank. I don't like the
word. I know you to be innocent of any intention
to rob the bank. Were it not so, I should
give you up at once."</p>

<p>"And claim the reward?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly. That's the way I earn my
living; but I have no such intention. I feel interested
in your case, and would like to see you
righted, if I can. Besides, it will pay me better
to help you recover the money than to choose
any other course. I make no secret of my motives.
They are purely mercenary, you see."</p>

<p>"I am just as much obliged to you, all the
same."</p>

<p>"You have reasons to be. The ordinary detective
would have marched you off to the station-house.
False witnesses would have been
brought against you beyond a doubt; you would
have been convicted, and under the provisions
of your grandfather's will could never have inherited
a cent."</p>

<p>"I don't seem likely to in any case, now that
the parchment describing the hiding-place of his
buried money is lost."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure. I have a feeling that we
shall yet succeed in finding that parchment. But
now for a question or two. How came those
boys&mdash;what do they call themselves&mdash;to lend you
a helping hand?"</p>

<p>"They call themselves the 'Bats in the
Wall.' Barney has been in the habit of blacking
my boots at the bank. That was the reason he
gave for helping me as he did."</p>

<p>"'Bats in the Wall,' eh? A good name.
That accounts for the bat-like cry Officer
Schneider heard. As for the reason, that don't
amount to anything. Depend upon it, these
boys would never had let you into their secret
for any such reason as that."</p>

<p>"What do you think was the reason?"</p>

<p>"Blest if I know. If I did, I am certain that
I would have the key to much that is now mysterious
about this strange affair. What do you
know about this Jerry Buck?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, except meeting him in the
wall as I did."</p>

<p>"There is something that boy is keeping
back," said the detective, musingly. "Now what
is it? That's the question. Have you noticed,
Frank, how much he resembles you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm sure, I haven't. Do you mean to
say he looks like me?"</p>

<p>"Enough like you to be your twin brother. I
never saw a more marked resemblance in my
life. But that is always the way. A man can
rarely see a resemblance to himself in the face of
any one else."</p>

<p>"Well, now you speak of it, I can see some
points in which we are alike. His hair is the
color of mine; his eyes are not unlike&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eyes, nose, mouth, everything," replied the
detective, quickly. "But never mind that now.
Tell me something of your own past&mdash;something
concerning that mother of yours."</p>

<p>Tears gathered in the boy's eyes.</p>

<p>"It is a sad, sad story, Mr. Hook," he replied,
brokenly. "After my father's misfortunes
she lost her reason, as I have already told
you. Mr. Callister, who had charge of our affairs,
had her removed to a private asylum, where she
has been most of the time ever since."</p>

<p>"What asylum was it?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Belding's, St. Nicholas avenue and 150th
street, up near the Fort Washington road."</p>

<p>"I know the locality. You say you went there
yesterday, and they told you she had escaped."</p>

<p>"Yes. She disappeared one night, some three
weeks ago."</p>

<p>"And you were not informed?"</p>

<p>"No. Mr. Callister had the matter in charge.
I visited the asylum from time to time, but they
would rarely allow me to see my mother, and
never at any time leave us alone."</p>

<p>"Was she very bad?"</p>

<p>"Well, pretty bad at times. She was particularly
violent in the presence of Mr. Callister."</p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered the detective, "I'm not
much surprised at that."</p>

<p>"She always had the idea that he was the
cause of my father's misfortunes, though I'm sure
I don't know why."</p>

<p>For a few moments the detective maintained
silence.</p>

<p>"What was the name of your mother before
your father married her, Frank?" he asked at
length.</p>

<p>"Helen Dupont."</p>

<p>"Where was she from?"</p>

<p>"She was born in the upper part of New York,
in what was then the village of Fort Washington."</p>

<p>"Has she any relatives?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I never heard her speak of her
past life at all."</p>

<p>"Then you have no idea why she should seek
such quarters as that house in the rear of the
Catherine Market, where we found her?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest, Mr. Hook. When I first
saw her in the street on that terrible night I
never was more surprised in my life. I ought
not to have left her even for a moment. I never
would have done so had I been myself."</p>

<p>"There, there. Don't think anything more
about it," said the detective, kindly, seeing that
Frank could no longer restrain the tears.
"Whisky makes fools of us all, my boy. Finish
your breakfast and we'll talk about these matters
later on."</p>

<p>He resumed the paper, leaving Frank to his
own bitter thoughts.</p>

<p>For the space of a few moments neither spoke.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with an exclamation of surprise and
satisfaction, Caleb Hook brought his hand down
upon the table with a thump which made the
dishes rattle.</p>

<p>"The very thing!" he exclaimed, excitedly.
"Frank Mansfield, fate is playing into our
hands."</p>

<p>He passed over the paper to Frank, with one
finger pressed upon the advertising columns.</p>

<p>"Read that," he said briefly, "and tell me
what you think of it."</p>

<p>It was an advertisement under the head of
"Clerks Wanted."</p>

<p>This was the way it read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Wanted</span>&mdash;A young man for a responsible
position in a broker's office. One familiar with
a general stock brokerage business preferred.
Apply to Elijah Callister, Room 62, &mdash;&mdash; Building,
Broad street."</p></blockquote>

<p>"What do you think of it?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Callister, certainly; but I don't see
how it concerns me?"</p>

<p>"You don't? What we want in this little
scheme of ours more than anything else is to set
a watch on this man; to trace out his movements,
to learn who his associates are, and what
interest he has with bank burglars and thieves,
such as the man in whose company you saw him
at the Catherine Market yesterday morning."</p>

<p>"Do you propose to send one of your men to
apply for the place?"</p>

<p>"One of my men! Why, I mean that you shall
apply for it, and get it, too."</p>

<p>Frank laughed.</p>

<p>"He'd know me at a glance," he said.</p>

<p>"Would he? We'll see about that. After a
certain costumer with whom I am acquainted is
through with you I don't think he would. But,
supposing you were so effectually disguised
that he could never recognize you, do you think
you could fill the position and play your part?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure I could. At all events I'm
not afraid to try."</p>

<p>"Good! That's the way to talk. I've been
studying you closely, my boy, and feel sure that
you could carry the thing through as well as any
actor living."</p>

<p>"Always providing that I can get the place. I
have no references, you know."</p>

<p>"That is easily fixed. The president of the
Stock Exchange is a cousin of mine. You shall
apply for that position this very morning with a
letter from him. Do you understand the duties
of such a position well enough to fill it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, perfectly. I learned all that in the
bank."</p>

<p>"Then come with me at once," exclaimed Detective
Hook, springing to his feet. "If you
want to clear your name before the world&mdash;if you
want to avenge the wrong done by that man
Callister to you and yours&mdash;embrace this opportunity
which fate has thrown in your path, and
never rest until you have read his secrets through
and through."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE GHOST OF THREE OAKS APPEARS AGAIN.</p>


<p>For an instant Elijah Callister stood riveted
to the floor.</p>

<p>Then, springing forward with a fierce imprecation
upon his lips, he approached the door of
the deserted chamber in the direction of which
the ghostly figure of the dead Mrs. Marley had
disappeared.</p>

<p>It was firmly locked.</p>

<p>He had himself thus locked it upon their first
entrance, not from fear of intrusion&mdash;that was
not to be expected in a mansion so utterly given
over to rats and the dust of neglect as this&mdash;but
from the natural tendency of a suspicious evil-doer
to perform his acts behind barred doors.</p>

<p>And even as he had left it so remained that
great oaken door now.</p>

<p>There had not been sufficient time for the
woman, were she living, to have even turned the
key, providing it had been in the lock.</p>

<p>But the key was not in the lock&mdash;it snugly reposed
at that very moment in the pocket of the
man himself.</p>

<p>Now, Elijah Callister did not believe in ghosts.</p>

<p>Search the length and breadth of New York
City over, and in all probability no less superstitious
man than the stock broker himself could
have been found.</p>

<p>He shook the latch fiercely.</p>

<p>It had not been disturbed&mdash;there could be no
doubt of that.</p>

<p>No other means of entrance to the chamber
existed save by one of the windows, forty feet
from the ground, at least.</p>

<p>A strange sense of fear seemed to creep over
him&mdash;a tightness about the heart.</p>

<p>There lay his villainous companion stretched
senseless upon the floor.</p>

<p>Neither window could have been approached
without passing directly by the place where the
man lay, where he himself had stood.</p>

<p>And yet the appearance had been a reality.</p>

<p>The figure of Mrs. Marley had advanced from
behind the broken bedstead, whose high headboard
offered an effective shield to the movements
of any object behind it, had moved forward
across the room, and retreated in the direction
from whence it came.</p>

<p>Seizing the lantern, Mr. Callister swept its
light underneath the bed.</p>

<p>The dust that everywhere filled the room was
there plentiful enough, but that was all.</p>

<p>There were no signs of its having been recently
disturbed&mdash;it lay in one unbroken sheet upon
the floor.</p>

<p>At that instant a terrific gust of wind swept
the rain fiercely against the panes.</p>

<p>And amid its moaning of the oaks without, and
the rattling of the rain upon the glass, a low,
mocking laugh was heard, seemingly from the
floor itself, which sent a chill to the very marrow
of his bones.</p>

<p>"This thing must be investigated," muttered
the man, striding toward the fire-place. "Either
that woman lives, or&mdash;but, pshaw! Don't I
know she is dead? I saw her killed with my own
eyes. I know that at this very moment her
body lies waiting identification in the Morgue.
There is some infernal trickery in all this; what
it means I must know and will."</p>

<p>Setting down the lantern by the side of the
hearth-stone, he seized the shoulder of the unconscious
man and shook it with all the violence he
could exert.</p>

<p>"Rube, Rube!" he cried, "what ails you,
man? For Heaven's sake, stop this nonsense and
try to be something like yourself!"</p>

<p>Slowly the eyes opened and Reuben Tisdale,
raising himself to a sitting posture, looked wildly
around.</p>

<p>"Lije, did you see her, or was it only meant
for me?"</p>

<p>"See her! Of course I saw her. There's some
infernal jugglery going on in this house, and I
propose to find out what it is."</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, no. It was Maria's spirit," he muttered.
"I killed her and she haunts me, and no wonder,
in this evil room."</p>

<p>"Well, and what's the matter with this room?"</p>

<p>"Can you ask?" said the man, shudderingly,
rising with difficulty to his feet. "After the
crime committed here on this very bed, can you
ask why this room should be evil to me?"</p>

<p>"I don't see what that has to do with it. If
that is your mode of reasoning it ought to be
the ghost of old man Mansfield, not of your
wife, that should appear to you here."</p>

<p>Again the man shuddered, glancing at the
same time nervously about him.</p>

<p>"I don't know what came over me," he muttered.
"I believe I must have fainted for the
first time since I was a boy. Lije, for heaven's
sake let's get out of this. I shall be of no more
use to you in this house to-night."</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," replied the
stock-broker, decidedly. "I shan't leave the
house until I've searched it from garret
to cellar and found out what this thing means.
If it were not that I know that she is closely
confined I might almost think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But what Mr. Callister might have almost
thought was destined never to find expression in
words, for, at that moment, his companion pressing
his hand to his forehead, reeled heavily forward
and would have fallen again had not the
broker caught him in his arms.</p>

<p>"Rube, for Heaven's sake," he exclaimed,
"what on earth ails you, man? One would
take you for a nervous woman instead of the
man you are from the way you act. Here, drink
this. It will put some heart in you, and then
we'll search this old barn together. If there is
a ghost in it, I'll warrant you I'll have it out."</p>

<p>He passed a whisky flask to the trembling Tisdale,
who pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p>"There, do you feel better?"</p>

<p>"Yes, somewhat, but I'm as weak as a rat
still."</p>

<p>"Well, then, come along. I'm bound to see
this out."</p>

<p>Striding toward the bedstead, he seized hold
of the headboard and tried to move it out into
the center of the room.</p>

<p>Weak and decayed before, this action proved
too much for the dilapidated piece of furniture.</p>

<p>With a loud crash it fell a mass of broken
rubbish to the floor, causing Tisdale to spring
back with a startled cry.</p>

<p>"Confound the old trap!" exclaimed Callister.
"But one thing is settled&mdash;what we saw is
neither under it nor behind it, that is clear.
Where the mischief it could have found means
to hide beats me. The door is locked, and the
rest of the room is all clear before us. There is
no place in which a cat could lie concealed."</p>

<p>He flung open the door of the closet as he
spoke.</p>

<p>It was empty.</p>

<p>Nothing but a heap of dust met his gaze.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, shortly, picking up the lantern
and producing the key from his pocket;
"there are rooms below and above. Let us
examine them all, and see if we can find trace of
her ghostship there."</p>

<p>He unlocked the door and led the way out
into the deserted hall.</p>

<p>To the right and left opened other doors, connecting
with the various chambers upon the
floor.</p>

<p>Opening each in turn, Callister and his companion
examined the rooms in silence.</p>

<p>One was a large guest chamber, containing
various articles of antique furniture; another
was a small bedroom, entirely vacant, and another
still a bath-room, filled with rubbish of
various kinds.</p>

<p>In neither one nor the other was there the
slightest trace of the form of the woman which
had appeared before them, nor evidence that the
dust which covered everything had been disturbed
for years.</p>

<p>Nor was their examination of the floor above
better rewarded.</p>

<p>Here piles of old lumber were found, broken
furniture, boxes, and bales.</p>

<p>Evidently years had passed since this portion
of the house had been occupied. From the appearance
presented there could be little doubt
that it had been used for storage purposes by its
miserly owner, who met death by violence on the
floor below.</p>

<p>The parlor floor, the kitchen, and even the cellar
itself, did not escape examination.</p>

<p>Equally to no purpose.</p>

<p>Some of the rooms were furnished, others were
not.</p>

<p>Everywhere the furnishings were green with
mold and sinking rapidly to decay.</p>

<p>No trace, not even so much as a footprint on
the dust-covered floors of the ghostly visitant
was anywhere found.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Lije," said Tisdale, hoarsely, as
they paused at length in the great hall at the
foot of the staircase which they had ascended
upon their first entrance to the house. "You
may search all night, but you'll find nothing. It
was poor Maria's spirit that we saw."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Reuben Tisdale! Do you mean to
tell me that at your time of life you are going to
give way to a belief in ghosts?"</p>

<p>"I didn't believe in them any more than you
until to-night, but, after what we saw, what is a
man to think?"</p>

<p>"I tell you it's a trick. This house has the
reputation of being haunted, brought about by
my own nocturnal searches within its walls.
Some one saw us enter, and followed us to give
us a scare."</p>

<p>Tisdale shook his head incredulously.</p>

<p>"Absurd," he said, with emphasis. "You
saw the thing as well as I. What did it look
like? Answer me that."</p>

<p>"Well, I must admit that it looked like
Maria."</p>

<p>"I should say so. Wasn't it her face, her
form, her dress? Do you suppose a man can forget
the form of his wife? I tell you no. Not if he
lived to be a thousand years old. Besides, I saw
the mark of my fist upon her forehead, poor girl.
Great God, to think that I should have struck
her dead at my feet! She who once loved me
more than all else on earth."</p>

<p>"Rube, you are acting like a perfect child!"
exclaimed Callister, impatiently. "Here we are
standing directly upon the verge of a precipice,
as it were, and you give way like this. Detectives
are on our track, man; the capture of Joe
Dutton, unless he can be silenced most effectually,
is likely to prove a fatal blow to us, and what
we want is money&mdash;money alone will pull us
through; without it all my influence in the business
world will go for naught."</p>

<p>"Well, you have money, folks say. Use it&mdash;it
is as much to your interest as the rest of us."</p>

<p>"Have I? So you say. Let me tell you, Rube
Tisdale, that my stock operations of the last year
have left me a well-nigh ruined man. I depended
upon this bank affair to put me on my feet
again. It has failed. If you had only preserved
that parchment more carefully, every dollar of
old Mansfield's wealth would now be within our
grasp."</p>

<p>"Oh! stow that!" cried Tisdale, angrily.
"What's the use of throwing all the blame on
me? The bank affair proved a failure, didn't it!
The parchment was lost, through my carelessness,
I'll admit. Let's face matters as they are,
and make the best of them we can. Come, let's
be off out of this. We can do no more here
to-night."</p>

<p>Callister blew out the lantern and opened
the door.</p>

<p>"I go," he said, sulkily, "but, mark you,
Rube, I shall return again. In a month's time,
under the will of Jeremiah Mansfield, which fortunately
is recorded in the Surrogate's office,
even if you did lose the original, this house and
all it contains belongs to me, if I can only
catch that cub of a boy and turn him over to
the law. Once in my possession, I'll raze it to
the foundation stones but I'll discover the secret
hidden by its moldering walls."</p>

<p>He slammed the door behind them, and descending
the piazza steps, started down the avenue
leading to the Fort Washington road beyond,
regardless of the pelting rain, his companion
following without a word.</p>

<p>Hard as it had poured all day long, and now
far into the night, not at any time had the storm
assumed such violence as now.</p>

<p>The water fell about them in torrents, the
wind swept through the tops of the tall oak-trees
with a wild, unearthly moan.</p>

<p>Now what possessed the man Tisdale to pause
before he had advanced ten paces from the old
mansion, and turn to survey its gloomy front
once more, is something we cannot tell.</p>

<p>But turn he did, and simultaneously with the
movement there broke from his lips a wild, unearthly
yell.</p>

<p>"Lije! For God's sake! There she is again!"</p>

<p>And Elijah Callister also turned.</p>

<p>From out of the darkness before him there
shot a blaze of light.</p>

<p>The door of the old mansion stood wide open.</p>

<p>The piazza, the great hall, and even the staircase
beyond, were to be seen illuminated with
the brightness of day.</p>

<p>And there, in the midst of that blaze of light,
upon the threshold of the door itself, stood the
form of the dead Mrs. Marley, pale and rigid,
with one thin, white finger pointing directly toward
himself and his frightened companion who
with chattering teeth stood trembling by his
side.</p>

<p>For one instant only the apparition maintained
its place.</p>

<p>The next, and all was darkness again.</p>

<p>With a loud cry of terror Reuben Tisdale
sprang down the avenue, and was lost from
view among the trees, while his companion, now
scarcely less alarmed, hurriedly followed in the
direction of the gate.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MR. CALLISTER'S CLERK.</p>


<p>"Ketchum &amp; Bustem, eight hundred Wabash
common, buyer three!"</p>

<p>"All right, Ketchum &amp; Bustem&mdash;there you
are."</p>

<p>Out of a little hole in the glass partition, which
divided the interior of Mr. Elijah Callister's office,
Room 62, &mdash;&mdash; Building, Broad street, from the
portion which was open to the outside public,
a hand was thrust, passing back a receipt book
to the waiting messenger of the well-known firm
of Ketchum &amp; Bustem, brokers on Broadway.</p>

<p>As no further messengers appeared, the transactions
of Mr. Callister upon the board that day
having been small, the door of the glass partition
was presently thrown open, and a young man,
neatly dressed, with a pen thrust behind his ear
appeared, and began to walk up and down the
office with a meditative air.</p>

<p>He was to all appearance of some twenty-eight
or twenty-nine years of age, certainly not over
thirty at the most.</p>

<p>Tall and straight, with light hair, which he
wore long about the neck, and mustache and
side whiskers, trimmed in the latest style.</p>

<p>Now, as the office was vacant, save for his own
presence, this new stock clerk of Mr. Callister's&mdash;for
it is this young man who has secured the
position in the stock broker's office, the advertisement
of which had attracted the keen eyes of
Detective Hook, fell to thinking, and, as is the
foolish custom of some people when alone, thinking
aloud:</p>

<p>"And so this is the beginning of my third week
here," he muttered, as he paced the office floor
up and down, in momentary expectation of the
return of his employer from the closing of the
Stock Exchange, "and so far all goes well. Mr.
Callister certainly does not suspect me&mdash;has not
from the first. That letter of Hook's procured
from his cousin, the president of the Exchange,
did the business; he hired me without the least
suspicion in the world.</p>

<p>"And to think that I should have been able
to play this part for two whole weeks," he continued;
"but I have done it, and I flatter myself
that it has been well performed. Not for a
moment has this man mistrusted that I am other
than what I seem, while on my part I have
learned much that will be invaluable&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here his reflections were interrupted by the
entry of the broker himself.</p>

<p>He was as suave and sleek as ever. To use an
old-fashioned expression, butter could not have
melted in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Maxwell, you are alone, I see. Although
forced by circumstances to remain indoors,
you are enjoying the beautiful afternoon,
I trust?"</p>

<p>"I am, Mr. Callister, as well as one can from
the window away up here above the street."</p>

<p>"Just so, Mr. Maxwell. My offices are somewhat
elevated, but so much nearer to Heaven,
my dear sir&mdash;so much nearer to Heaven&mdash;and
when you come to consider, there is much that
is beautiful in the thought. Have Ketchum &amp;
Bustem reported that lot of Wabash?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And Brownell &amp; Popkins the Brazilian
sixes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Callister. Those were reported an
hour ago."</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Maxwell&mdash;very good, indeed.
I have some important papers to prepare, and
shall now retire to my private office. If any one
calls, show them in."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Callister."</p>

<p>"And, Maxwell?"</p>

<p>"Sir."</p>

<p>"Should you feel so inclined, I should be
pleased to see you at our prayer-meeting to-morrow
night, at the Tenth Baptist Church. I
take the deepest interest in the welfare of all
young men."</p>

<p>Thereupon, Mr. Elijah Callister, smiling blandly,
entered his private office, closed and locked
the door.</p>

<p>"You old hypocrite!" muttered the clerk,
shaking his fist at the oaken panels. "You miserable,
canting fraud. Never would I have believed
you to be what you are had I not witnessed
your duplicity and double dealing now
daily for the past two weeks with my own eyes."</p>

<p>And the assumed Mr. Maxwell, in whom no
one, not even, we venture to say, Caleb Hook
himself, had he not been in the secret, would
have recognized our young friend, Frank Mansfield,
resumed his seat at the desk behind the
glass partition, and began figuring away upon a
large book of accounts.</p>

<p>Yes, it was Frank Mansfield.</p>

<p>Detective Hook's plan had succeeded to the
letter.</p>

<p>For two weeks he had been an inmate of the
business office of the man who had plotted his
ruin.</p>

<p>And during that short lapse of time many
things had occurred.</p>

<p>Let us narrate them briefly, as they are highly
essential to a correct understanding of subsequent
events.</p>

<p>In the first place, the matter of the Webster
bank robbery remains still a mystery. It is generally
believed that Frank Mansfield was at least
a participant in the crime, a guilty tool of the
thieves.</p>

<p>From the moment of his escape from Officer
Schneider, the whereabouts of that young gentleman
have been a matter of mystery to the
world.</p>

<p>When, through the accident which had happened
to Detective Hook, the burglar Joe Dutton
had been captured with his basket of stolen
dollars at the Catherine Market, it had been
thought by the police authorities that a speedy
solution of the mystery was at hand.</p>

<p>They were mistaken.</p>

<p>During the four days of his confinement in
the Tombs the captured criminal could not be
persuaded to utter a word.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fifth day burglar Joe
Dutton was found lying dead upon the floor of
his cell.</p>

<p>Upon the same day occurred the funeral of the
murdered Mrs. Marley.</p>

<p>Through some unknown source a lot had been
purchased in a suburban cemetery. Detective
Hook and Frank Mansfield, concealed within a
closed carriage, were the sole mourners who
followed to the grave.</p>

<p>Not the slightest clew to the perpetrator of
this cowardly murder had been obtained by the
police, but then they had not exerted themselves
very violently, you see.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marley was only a poor, half crazy woman&mdash;there
was no money in the case.</p>

<p>But in the busy rush of New York already
were these matters well-nigh forgotten.</p>

<p>The robbery of the Webster bank, the disappearance
of Frank Mansfield, and the murder of
Mrs. Marley were all things of the past.</p>

<p>Maxwell, the clerk, had been engaged at his
books not over an hour&mdash;and even that short
space of time had sufficed to bring the short
winter's day nearly to a close&mdash;when the office
door again opened and a flashily dressed young
man smoking a long cigar entered.</p>

<p>"Callister about?" he asked, with an air of
general proprietorship of the whole establishment.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell peeped through the little round
opening in the glass partition and immediately
opened the door.</p>

<p>"He's in, but very busy," he replied, stepping
into the outer room.</p>

<p>"Tell him Detective Cutts wants to see him,
will you, young feller?" said the individual with
the cigar.</p>

<p>Now the appearance of Mr. Billy Cutts, police
detective, as a visitor at the stock broker's office
caused the newly engaged clerk no surprise.</p>

<p>The fact was, Detective Cutts had been a daily
caller upon Mr. Callister for more than a week.</p>

<p>Of the nature of the man's business Maxwell,
the clerk, was unaware, but it appeared to be involved
in much mystery, and was invariably conducted
behind locked doors.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cutts, sir," said the clerk, as the door of
the broker's office was opened in response to his
knock.</p>

<p>"Show him in, Mr. Maxwell. Show him in,"
was the bland reply.</p>

<p>And during that momentary glimpse of the interior
of the private office, the assumed Maxwell
saw that the desk was littered with papers and
large drawings, closely resembling architects'
plans, strange things to be seen in a stock
broker's office, to say the least.</p>

<p>Detective Cutts had not been closeted with
Mr. Callister ten minutes, when the door of the
outer office opened again, and a sweet, womanly
voice was heard inquiring for the broker without
the glass partition.</p>

<p>As the voice fell upon the ears of the disguised
Frank Mansfield his heart seemed to rise in his
throat.</p>

<p>It was the voice of Miss Edna Callister, loved
by him as deeply as her father was despised.</p>

<p>By the earnest advice of Detective Hook, to
whom the young man had confided his tender
feelings for this beautiful girl, Frank had refrained
from visiting the object of his affection
or holding any communication with her at all.</p>

<p>Difficult and trying as this had been, it was
certainly a wise precaution, as can be readily
seen.</p>

<p>How much under the influence of her father
the girl might be it was impossible to tell.</p>

<p>Not that Frank loved her the less for the wrong
that parent had attempted to do him. But he
now saw things by a new and less selfish light
than ever before.</p>

<p>Had he the right to aspire to the affections of
the daughter, when against the father he was
working night and day?</p>

<p>The severest test to which his disguise had yet
been subjected was now about to occur.</p>

<p>Could the eyes of love be deceived?</p>

<p>There was no time to hesitate, and Frank,
mastering all his self-control, stepped from behind
the glass partition into the office beyond.</p>

<p>"Mr. Callister is engaged just at present, miss.
Will you please to give me your name, and I
will let him know that you are here."</p>

<p>"Say to him that Miss Callister would like to
see him," replied the young lady, her clear blue
eyes resting upon the face of the clerk.</p>

<p>"Please be seated. I will inform him at
once."</p>

<p>"Edna, you here!" exclaimed the broker, in
tones of surprise, as he hurriedly emerged from
the office, closing the door carefully behind him,
not, however, without enabling the watchful
eyes of the disguised clerk to catch a glimpse of
Detective Cutts poring over the plans upon the
desk within.</p>

<p>"Yes, father," replied the girl, coldly, "I am
here, as you see."</p>

<p>"Mr. Maxwell, oblige me by stepping out into
the hall a moment," said the broker, hurriedly.
"I wish to speak with my daughter alone, and
Mr. Cutts is too busy to be disturbed."</p>

<p>Frank obeyed.</p>

<p>Evidently Mr. Callister had forgotten the open
fan-light above the door, which afforded ample
opportunity for any one in the hall outside who
chose to stand close beneath it and listen to hear
every loud word spoken within. Otherwise he
might have lowered his voice a trifle, perhaps
even have spoken less harshly than he did.</p>

<p>"What brings you here, girl?" were the first
words the listener heard. "How many times
have I told you not to come to this office?"</p>

<p>"It makes no difference," was the reply of the
daughter, in clear, ringing tones. "I come
here because I choose to come. Knowing you
as I do, father, I have long since ceased to love
you. Can you then expect me to obey?"</p>

<p>"I'll find means to force obedience if you don't
give it willingly. What do you want?"</p>

<p>"To know what you have done with Frank
Mansfield."</p>

<p>"Impertinent jade! Why do you come to inquire
of the movements of that young rascal from
me? I have told you already that I know nothing
of him at all. His companions, the bank robbers,
could tell you, perhaps. Hunt them out
and ask them."</p>

<p>"I am convinced from the remark you let fall
in my presence last night that you know more of
Frank than you choose to tell. He left me to
come to you for the purpose of asking your consent
to our marriage, and has not been seen
since. What have you done with him, I ask
again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he has. You forgot the trifling fact
that your beloved was caught in the act of robbing
the Webster Bank."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it&mdash;I will never believe it. I
demand to know what you have done with Frank.
I know only too well that it is for your interest
to put him out of the way."</p>

<p>"You are a silly fool!" the voice of the father
was heard to angrily exclaim. "Go back to your
dolls and your playthings. If I catch you here
again I will lock you up on bread and water for
a month."</p>

<p>To this speech there was no reply, but at the
same instant the door of the office opened.</p>

<p>The disguised listener drew hurriedly back.</p>

<p>He was not quick enough, however, to avoid
coming face to face with the daughter of his employer.</p>

<p>Their eyes met.</p>

<p>It was for an instant only, but in that instant
the pale face of the girl blushed rosy red.</p>

<p>Love penetrates all disguises.</p>

<p>Frank saw instantly that his was no longer of
avail so far as those loving eyes were concerned.</p>

<p>"Shall I assist you to the elevator, Miss Callister?"
he asked, quietly, stepping to her side.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir."</p>

<p>And they stood together by the door of the
elevator shaft, the car at that moment being
seen descending from the story above.</p>

<p>Suddenly the girl, extending her dainty, gloved
hand grasped that of the youth within her own.</p>

<p>"I still visit the old place," she whispered,
hurriedly. "Oh, Frank, to know that you are
alive and well lifts a great load from my heart.
Never doubt that it still beats alone for you."</p>

<p>The door is flung open&mdash;the elevator has come.</p>

<p>The door is closed&mdash;the elevator has gone.</p>

<p>And Frank Mansfield, turning, beheld the tall
form of Elijah Callister regarding him malevolently
from the threshold of the open office beyond.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">JERRY BUCK PLAYS THE PART OF A DETECTIVE
AGAIN.</p>


<p>It was after eight o'clock when Mr. Elijah
Callister left the &mdash;&mdash; Building, Broad street, by
the side door opening upon Exchange Place,
and the night had turned off cold.</p>

<p>Detective Cutts was still with him, and buttoning
their overcoats about them, both hurried off
in the direction of William Street, with the air of
men having business on hand.</p>

<p>As for Frank Mansfield, he had left the office
of the stock-broker a good three hours before,
with his mind full of doubts and fears.</p>

<p>"My daughter is quite capable of taking care
of herself, Mr. Maxwell," the broker had said in
his usual oily tones, as Frank returned to the
office after the little scene enacted at the elevator
door. "In future I beg you will be less attentive
to any ladies who may chance to favor my
office with a visit."</p>

<p>With this rebuke he had shut himself up in the
private office with Mr. Billy Cutts again, and
was seen no more up to the usual hour for closing
the office, when Frank, without attempting
to even say good-night, simply put on his hat
and walked out, wholly undetermined as to
whether his hasty communication with Miss
Edna Callister had been overheard.</p>

<p>As the stock broker and the detective hurried
along the southerly side of Exchange place&mdash;we
mean the side where the street dealers in government
bonds spend their entire time during
business hours in leaning against the iron railings
of the basement offices awaiting customers
for their wares&mdash;there crept out from a doorway
a ragged, shivering newsboy, hugging a great
bundle of the evening papers tightly under his
arm.</p>

<p>Shooting a hasty glance at the men before him,
he bounded ahead over the icy sidewalk, shouting
at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Fo'rt Commercial, Nooiz or Telegram! Evenin'
papers, gents?"</p>

<p>Evidently the "gents" were disinclined for the
evening paper, for Callister, rudely pushing the
boy aside, crossed William street and paused opposite
the great stone building occupied by the
Lispenard Bank, one of the wealthiest of the
wealthy financial institutions in New York.</p>

<p>For an instant only the pause was made; but
during that instant the stock broker, with a
hurried glance up and down the street&mdash;there
was no one but the newsboy in sight, and he
was half a block away&mdash;unrolled a stiff paper
plan which he took from under his coat, and
giving one end of it to Cutts to hold, pointed first
at the plan and then at the building of the Lispenard
Bank again.</p>

<p>"Fo'rt Commercial! Nooiz! Telegram or German!
Evenin' paper, gents?"</p>

<p>Again the newsboy stood by their side, looking
almost over their shoulder at the plan they held
between them, as he thrust his bunch of papers
in the broker's face.</p>

<p>"No, you young imp!" exclaimed Callister.
"These newsboys are thicker than flies about
here. I tell you, Billy, there's no trouble about
it&mdash;no trouble at all. An entrance can be effected
as easy as rolling off a log. And as to money,
why, good Lord, it's the clearing house, you
know, and there's always money there. Come,
let's get down and show these to your father,
and see what he thinks of the idea."</p>

<p>He rolled up the plans hastily, and putting
them under his overcoat, moved off up William
street toward Wall, the detective keeping pace
by his side.</p>

<p>At that moment the newsboy crept out from
under the shadows of the Custom House fence
and followed them, dodging from one side of the
street to the other, calling his papers, and occasionally
stopping to sell one, but always keeping
the forms of Messrs. Cutts and Callister plainly
in view.</p>

<p>"I've got yer now, yer sly old rat!" he muttered,
as he crossed Wall street close at their
heels. "An', by gracious, I orter after all the
time I spent a-watchin'. I seen them papers
wat's got the picter of the Lispenard bank onter
them. If she an' me don't spoil yer little game
this time 'twon't be no faalt of Jerry Buck's, an'
don't yer forget it!"</p>

<p>Who "she was" did not appear as yet.</p>

<p>Certainly, in his present position, Master Jerry
Buck was playing the part of a detective quite
alone.</p>

<p>Down William street to Liberty, down Liberty
to its junction with Malden Lane, down Malden
Lane to Pearl street the men advanced, all unconscious
of the ragged youth who followed
close at their heels.</p>

<p>Turning to the left, they kept along Pearl
street, beneath the shadows of the great structure
of the elevated railroad, nor did they make
another turn until Franklin Square was reached.</p>

<p>And when they passed beneath the roadway of
the Brooklyn Bridge and entered Cherry street,
smelling of a thousand and one ill odors, suggestive
of anything save the luscious fruit from which
its name is derived, Jerry Buck was still behind
them.</p>

<p>He had ceased to call his papers now, but stood
silently watching them from between two empty
trucks drawn up by the side of the curbstone, as
they entered the very house on the easterly side
of Cherry street, just beyond Catherine, which he
had pointed out to Frank Mansfield upon the occasion
of their Sunday morning visit to the
Catherine Market as the one into which the burglars
of the Webster Bank had disappeared.</p>

<p>No sooner had the two men passed through
the doorway than the newsboy, pulling his tattered
felt hat low down over his eyes, quietly
crossed the street, entered the house himself, and
crept silently after them up the rickety stairs,
just in time to see Detective Cutts, the man paid
by the City for the detection of crime, and Mr.
Elijah Callister, the pious brother of the Tenth
Baptist Church, disappear within the rear room
on the second landing of the tenement, the door
of which was immediately closed.</p>

<p>Then Jerry Buck, giving utterance to a peculiar
chuckle, slipped past the door, mounted still
another pair of stairs and tapped lightly upon the
panels of the door of the room immediately
above.</p>

<p>It was presently opened, and a woman's head
and shoulders thrust out into the hall.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Jerry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, missus, it's me."</p>

<p>The door was softly opened wide and closed
again, the boy slipping into the room.</p>

<p>"Them fellers meets down-stairs again to-night,
missus. They means business this time,
and no mistake."</p>

<p>"Is he there?" asked the woman.</p>

<p>"You bet! Didn't I jest see him go in! I've
been a-layin' for him, a-followin' of him since
five o'clock. Cutts the detective is with him,
too."</p>

<p>"You are a good boy, Jerry," said the woman,
tears springing to her eyes. "God will reward
you for what you've done for me."</p>

<p>"Do you think so, missus? 'Twan't much, after
all. When I seed you a-tryin' to jump inter
the river I stopped you. When you told me yer
troubles, an' how that old mean snide, Callister,
had robbed your husband and killed him, an'
how he had treated you an' was a-tryin' to treat
yer boy, why I jest took a-holt an' helped yer,
an' the rest has come about of itself."</p>

<p>For reply, the woman stroked the boy's tumbled
hair, and then, as if moved by some sudden
impulse, stooped and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Looka here!" exclaimed Jerry, half pleased,
half ashamed. "I never had no one do that to
me before, but then you seem somehow jest as
though you were my own mother, so I suppose
it's all right."</p>

<p>"And you never knew your mother?" asked
the woman, regarding the boy with a wistful air.</p>

<p>She was a person who had evidently seen
much sorrow.</p>

<p>Tall and thin, with gray hair tied tightly in a
knot behind her head, poorly but respectably
dressed, there was about her an unmistakable
air of refinement, indicative of quite a different
position in life from the one in which we now
find her.</p>

<p>For surely the carpetless room, cheap table
and chairs, the little stove and scanty display of
common dishes through the half open closet door
were indicative of anything but plenty and comfort,
to say the least.</p>

<p>But they were miles and miles ahead of anything
Jerry Buck was accustomed to, and he regarded
them with an almost respectful air, as he
replied:</p>

<p>"No, missus, I never had no father nor mother
as I remember. I've always lived about the
streets."</p>

<p>"But you must have some early remembrances,"
continued the woman. "Can't you
tell me what they are?"</p>

<p>"Yes, some other time. Them fellers have
been in the room below for full five minutes. If
we are a-goin' to ketch onto their racket, we'd
better be about it, I should say."</p>

<p>And as he spoke Jerry Buck, creeping behind
the stove, threw himself flat on his stomach upon
the uncarpeted floor, close by the mouth of a
small round hole, through which in some former
time, when the house had been occupied by the
old Quaker families once resident in this part of
New York, a stove-pipe had passed, conveying
heat to this upper chamber from the room beneath.</p>

<p>A thin sheet of paper covered the opening upon
the ceiling in the room below them, through
which a light could be seen shining dimly and
the sounds of men's voices distinctly heard.</p>

<p>The woman now seated herself likewise upon
the floor, and, in common with the boy, bent
over the hole.</p>

<p>Had they been in the chamber beneath them,
they could not have heard the words of its occupants
more plainly.</p>

<p>Sound rises, as is well known to every one.
Through the round opening every syllable uttered
fell with startling distinctness upon their
ears.</p>

<p>"I tell you the job's an immense one, Rube,
whether Sam Cutts can see it or not."</p>

<p>"That's old Callister," murmured Jerry in a
low whisper.</p>

<p>"Hush!" replied the woman, speaking in tones
equally low, at the same time holding up her
hand. "I know his wicked voice only too well,
I'm not likely to forget the voice of one who has
brought the ruin he has done upon me and
mine."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not kicking," came a man's voice
up the tube.</p>

<p>"The plan looks all right, and Lije talks all
right. It's a big scheme on paper, but the question
is, won't it prove another Webster bank
affair? Providin' it works, will there be enough
shug in the vault to pay us for our trouble?
That's what I want to know in advance."</p>

<p>"Why, it's the Clearing House for all the other
banks, man," replied Callister's voice, impatiently.
"There's always money, thousands upon
thousands, in the vaults of the Lispenard bank,
I'm a director in it myself, and I guess I ought
to know."</p>

<p>"And these plans&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are drawn from personal knowledge of the
interior of the bank and its vault. Let me tell
you, Sam Cutts, this is the biggest thing of the
kind I ever put you on to. Billy here knows
that I'm giving it to you straight."</p>

<p>"Rat-tat-tat! Rat-tat-tat!" Both Jerry Buck
and the woman were upon their feet in an instant.</p>

<p>The rapping was upon the door of the room
in which the listeners were.</p>

<p>"Who can it be!" whispered the woman, turning
pale.</p>

<p>"Give it up. Better throw suthin over the
hole while I open the door an' see. It's some
of the neighbors have come to borry suthin',
most like, or a peddler mebbe."</p>

<p>"Rat-tat-tat! Rat-tat-tat!"</p>

<p>The boy hastily crossed the room, and turning
the key, cautiously opened the door upon
the crack.</p>

<p>Instantly a man sprang into the room, and
seizing Jerry by the shoulders with a vise-like
grip, clapped one hand over his mouth.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">FRANK VISITS COTTAGE PLACE.</p>


<p>Cottage Place is one of the by-ways.</p>

<p>No man in his sober senses would attempt to
describe it otherwise.</p>

<p>Starting from Bleecker street, and running in a
winding manner south-easterly to Houston, it
affords with its snug little dwellings, its blossoming
gardens in the grass-plat centers before the
low, red brick cottages, from which it derives its
name, a quiet abode for a few old-time families
of moderate means, whose necessities compel
them to live and maintain some show of respectability
in this most undesirable quarter of New
York.</p>

<p>But the flowers do not blossom in the winter
before the brick dwellings of Cottage Place, and
as the evening we are about to speak of is that
of the day upon which Miss Edna Callister visited
her father's office in Broad street, winter is the
season with which we have to deal.</p>

<p>It was still early&mdash;the factory whistles had not
yet blown for six, when the lithe, well-dressed
figure of Maxwell, Mr. Callister's new clerk
might have been seen to drop from a Bleecker
street car, and, turning into Cottage Place, enter
the gate of the snug little cottage bearing the
number "9" over its doorway, and hastily ring
the bell.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that it was already
dark, he seemed to display a familiarity with the
house and its surroundings which indicated with
perfect plainness that this was by no means his
first visit.</p>

<p>Standing upon the little stoop while awaiting
the answer to his ring, the eyes of the young man
wandered toward the windows of the first or parlor
floor, which, as the house was without basement,
stood but slightly raised from the level of
the ground.</p>

<p>The blinds were thrown back, but the curtains
were drawn, a light burning brightly, suggesting
a comfortable, home-like interior within.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she's there," escaped the young
man's lips as he gazed upon the curtains. "I
feel sure she is, and though I am acting in direct
opposition to Mr. Hook's express instructions, I
know, I could stand it no longer&mdash;I had to come.</p>

<p>"Dear Edna! Never did I fully realize the
depth of love until now. Never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door was opened suddenly.</p>

<p>A stout, motherly-looking woman stood gazing
inquiringly upon his face.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brown! It's an age since I've seen you.
Is Edna here to-night!"</p>

<p>The young man had sprung eagerly forward,
extending his hand toward the woman as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Edna! Who are you, sir? I don't know
what you mean."</p>

<p>Frank Mansfield laughed.</p>

<p>All eagerness to meet once more the girl he
loved, he had for the moment forgotten his disguise.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brown, don't you know me?"</p>

<p>"It's Frank Mansfield's voice. Can this be
you?"</p>

<p>"It's no one else, auntie," replied Frank,
laughing, at the same time closing the door
behind him. "I forgot that my face had changed."</p>

<p>"I should have never known you," replied the
woman, doubtfully. "She's inside, and expecting
you, Frank. But, good gracious me! I don't
know whether I'm doing right or wrong to let
you meet here so. What a terrible scrape you've
got yourself into! We thought you had run
away."</p>

<p>"Not yet, auntie, not yet. When I get ready
to do such a thing as that I shall let you, my
dear old nurse, into the secret first, now you
may depend. But where is she? In the little
parlor as usual? I'm just dying to hold my darling
in my arms again."</p>

<p>The woman threw open a door without a word,
displaying a small but neatly furnished room.</p>

<p>"Edna!"</p>

<p>The daughter of Elijah Callister stood before
the open grate.</p>

<p>Frank rushed toward her with extended hand.</p>

<p>"My love! my darling!" he cried, impetuously.
"Thank God, we are together again!"</p>

<p>The young girl drew back.</p>

<p>Her face was pale, her bosom heaved&mdash;there
were tears resting in her eyes.</p>

<p>"One moment," she said, with an evident
struggle. "It seems to me, Frank Mansfield,
that, before admitting you to your old-time
place in my heart, some explanation is due to
me."</p>

<p>At the same instant the door was heard to
close.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown had discreetly retired, leaving the
lovers alone.</p>

<p>Frank drew back abashed.</p>

<p>"I thought after what you said this afternoon&mdash;"
he began, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"That I stood ready to receive you, without
explanation, on your old footing? No, sir, nothing
of the sort! I have some questions to put to
you before that can be done."</p>

<p>"Edna, I am yours&mdash;yours body and soul!
Ask me what questions you please."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, where have you been during all
these weeks? You stand accused of a terrible
crime before the world. If you are innocent,
why have you not communicated with me? Why
have you not come to tell me so before?"</p>

<p>"Edna, I am innocent. I swear it before Almighty
God and you, the woman I love."</p>

<p>"I believe it. I maintained it against my
father, against all the sneers and reproaches that
he heaped upon your name. But when day after
day passed, and I heard nothing from you, what
was I to believe? What am I to believe now,
finding you in my father's office and in disguise?"</p>

<p>For the space of a moment Frank stood gazing
upon her beautiful form in a maze of perplexity
and doubt.</p>

<p>What should he do? What should he say?</p>

<p>To betray his plans to the daughter of his enemy
was to frustrate them. He could see it at a
glance.</p>

<p>"Hook was right," he thought, bitterly. "I
have made a mistake. I ought not to have come
at all."</p>

<p>He gazed sadly upon the girl for an instant,
and then taking his hat from the table upon
which he had thrown it, motioned to withdraw.</p>

<p>"Edna, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stood hesitating now, his hand upon the
knob of the door.</p>

<p>Instantly the girl's manner changed.</p>

<p>Springing forward, she threw herself in the
arms of her lover, and burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"Frank! Frank! Don't go. I can forgive anything,
everything, but your slight to me."</p>

<p>"My slight to you, dearest?"</p>

<p>He led her gently toward a sofa near the window,
and seated himself by her side.</p>

<p>"It's weeks since I have seen you, Frank. In
your trouble could you not trust me?"</p>

<p>"Can you trust me, little girl?" he cried, clasping
both her hands within his own.</p>

<p>"Can you trust me, when I tell you that I did
not rob the Webster Bank, that I am not guilty
of the terrible crime with which the newspapers
have had me charged?"</p>

<p>"Frank, I can trust you in anything; but only
think! It is three weeks since you left me in this
very room&mdash;left me to seek my father and ask
his consent to our marriage. I have not seen
you since."</p>

<p>"Dearest. I could not help it. I saw your
father. He refused my request. I&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;I
have been so situated that I could neither see
nor communicate with you since."</p>

<p>The cheeks of the youth blushed red as he
spoke.</p>

<p>The memory of his dissipation and folly in the
presence of this innocent girl seemed to crowd
upon him with crushing force.</p>

<p>How unworthy he was of love like this? How&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But his thoughts were interrupted.</p>

<p>Edna Callister had spoken again.</p>

<p>"Frank, I believe your innocence firmly,"
she said, in clear, decided tones, "I believe it
first because I know your heart, second, because&mdash;because&mdash;oh,
how can I say it! Because&mdash;Frank,
you will not betray me&mdash;because my
father tries to make me think you guilty, and I
know my father to be a very wicked man."</p>

<p>"Edna!"</p>

<p>"It is true, Frank. You know it is true. It
is my firm belief that he is at the bottom of a
plot against you, and that you know this to be
the fact. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Edna, I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"But you must. I insist upon knowing. It
is because you have discovered his baseness at
last, because you know what I say to be true
that you have kept away from me, and hate me
for all I know. It is for this reason that you are
watching him in his office in this disguise."</p>

<p>"Edna, I love you and shall love you always,
no matter what your father may be to me. I
promise faithfully&mdash;&mdash; Hark! what noise was
that?"</p>

<p>It was the sound of some one without the
window tapping gently upon the pane.</p>

<p>Rising hastily, Frank strode to the window
and raised the shade.</p>

<p>"Great Heaven! again!"</p>

<p>With face the color of death the young man
leaped back from the window, the perspiration
starting in great drops from his pallid brow.</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;look! Do you see her?" he breathed,
hoarsely, pointing with one finger toward the
window facing which both the lovers now stood.</p>

<p>"Why, Frank, it's your mother! What in the
world can she be doing here?"</p>

<p>It was a woman who stood in the little courtyard
without, her face pressed against the pane.</p>

<p>It was the strange woman who has already
figured very prominently in this tale&mdash;the mother
of Frank Mansfield, whom he believed as firmly
as he believed in his own existence to be now lying
in her grave.</p>

<p>The face, form, figure were all the same.</p>

<p>The apparition of Trinity church-yard stood
before him now.</p>

<p>With one hand, she struck the window feebly
as with the other she raised what appeared to be
a piece of paper before the eyes of the astonished
pair.</p>

<p>Then, laying the paper against the glass, she
drew back into the darkness and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Remain where you are, Edna!" cried Frank,
springing toward the door. "In a moment I
will return."</p>

<p>He was in the street in an instant.</p>

<p>Too late!</p>

<p>The woman was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>But there upon the window-sill, leaning
against the glass, still rested a folded parchment,
affording the most positive evidence of her
presence before the house.</p>

<p>Search was useless.</p>

<p>Whoever the strange creature might be&mdash;if a
being of this world indeed&mdash;she had but to turn
the corner of Bleecker street to lose herself in
the crowd.</p>

<p>With his mind filled with a thousand doubts
and fears, Frank seized the parchment and returned
to the room.</p>

<p>Without speaking a word he strode toward the
table, and spread it out beneath the lighted
lamp.</p>

<p>His eyes had scarce rested upon it than he
uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise.</p>

<p>And no wonder.</p>

<p>It was the description of the treasure hidden
by old Jeremiah Mansfield, his grandfather,
which lay before him.</p>

<p>As though a gift from Heaven, it had been restored
to him.</p>

<p>He had watched and waited.</p>

<p>The missing parchment had been placed in his
hands.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AN UNTIMELY OCCURRENCE&mdash;CALEB HOOK DISCOVERED.</p>


<p>"Hist&mdash;hist, Jerry Buck!" whispered Detective
Hook as he slipped through the door opened
by the newsboy. "You are a smart lad&mdash;a
bright lad&mdash;to track those fellows as you have.
I watched you do it, but, having got them into
close quarters, we must put our heads together
and find out what's going on in the room below."</p>

<p>Both Jerry Buck and the woman drew back in
startled surprise.</p>

<p>The appearance of the detective thus unexpectedly,
was, to judge from the countenances of
both, anything but welcome to them.</p>

<p>For the moment even the ready wit of the
Bat seemed to desert him, and he glanced from
the face of the woman, who stood motionless behind
the stove with her foot covering the hole in
the floor, to that of Caleb Hook with an appearance
of deep perplexity, not unmingled with
fear.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, mister.
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, Jerry. This is no time to lie. You
know me well enough. Have you forgotten the
morning at the Catherine Market&mdash;my visit to
the Bats in the Wall?"</p>

<p>"Well, s'pose I hain't? What's that got to do
with it? This here's a private room. What call
have you got to run your nose in here?"</p>

<p>"One moment, Jerry," said the detective,
coolly pushing the boy aside and advancing into
the room.</p>

<p>"Madam, your most obedient," he continued,
bowing respectfully to the woman. "My name
is Hook. I am a police detective and the best
friend Frank Mansfield has got. May I trouble
you to tell me who and what you are?"</p>

<p>The woman trembled before him.</p>

<p>A wild, hunted look overshadowed her face; her
eyes wandered restlessly about the room.</p>

<p>"I harm no one, sir," she murmured. "I only
wish to be let alone that I may complete the work
of vengeance which I have begun against the
man who has brought so much misery to me and
mine."</p>

<p>"Just so, madam, just so," answered Caleb
Hook, soothingly. "You refer to Mr. Callister,
no doubt, who is now in the room below. I stand
ready to help you in your work if I can."</p>

<p>"But you are the detective who arrested my&mdash;Frank,
I mean."</p>

<p>"I did, but I have stood his friend from that
night until now. I am anxious to help him and
all belonging to him. Are you not the person to
whom I spoke at the Trinity church-yard wall on
the night of the arrest? Did you not tell me that
Frank Mansfield was your son, and that he robbed
the Webster bank?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I was mistaken. I was mad!" exclaimed
the woman, springing forward wildly.
"I have no son, he robbed no bank. Go away
and leave me alone."</p>

<p>"'Tain't no use to make him mad, missus,"
whispered the newsboy. "Frank trusts him an'
I guess the best thing will be for us to trust him
too."</p>

<p>"You are right, Jerry," said the detective
quietly. "Neither this good lady nor yourself
have anything to fear from me."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! Ha! ha! ha! You can just
bet your life the detective will never get into this
little racket&mdash;never in the world."</p>

<p>From the room below these words, accompanied
by loud and boisterous laughter, suddenly
burst forth, the sound finding easy passage
through the uncovered stove pipe hole in the
floor.</p>

<p>The effect upon the woman was electrical.</p>

<p>Advancing quickly toward Caleb Hook, she
grasped him by the hand.</p>

<p>"That's his voice," she whispered wildly.
"Help me to bring that man to the hangman's
scaffold and I'll fall down and bless you on my
bended knees. It is Elijah Callister that robbed
me of my husband; it is he who robbed me of
my reason, and would have robbed me of my son.
Oh, if I could only trust you, sir! If I could only
trust you! How can a weak woman like myself,
with no other help than that of this faithful boy,
hope to bring justice upon his sinful head alone."</p>

<p>"You may trust me fully, madam. I too have
a grievance against Elijah Callister. Will you
help me to bring him into the grasp of the law
which he has so long defied?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes! Let them hang him as high as
Haman! Oh, that I could only dance on his
grave!"</p>

<p>She spoke wildly&mdash;excitedly. That her mind
was far from clear was plainly to be seen.</p>

<p>That she hated Elijah Callister with a deep and
bitter hatred was equally plain.</p>

<p>Caleb Hook, watching her closely, saw all this,
and understanding that his opportunity had
come, proceeded to grasp it at once.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you know, and you shall do
it!" he said, emphatically. "I swear that your
desire shall be fulfilled! Who and what is this
smooth-spoken Callister&mdash;that's what I want to
know?"</p>

<p>"Who is he?" cried the woman. "He is a
hypocrite, a liar, a murderer, a thief! I have
been watching him for weeks, and I know what
I say is true. He is the man who concocted the
robbery at the Webster bank, and tried to throw
the crime upon my son."</p>

<p>"Ah! Then you are Mrs. Mansfield, the mother
of Frank? I thought as much from the first."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes; they locked me in an asylum, but
I outwitted them and got away, but too late to
save my boy from harm. They drew the net
around him, but I will tear it off. I will live to
see those wretches swing for their crimes when
Frank is rich and prosperous. I say it, sir, and
I mean it. God will grant a mother's prayer!"</p>

<p>She fumbled at her dress as she spoke these
words, and producing a package of greasy, worn
papers, thrust them into the detective's hand.</p>

<p>"Read&mdash;read!" she exclaimed, her eyes darting
to the right and left more wildly than before.
"I have written it all down for the world to read
when my work is done. But you, who love my
boy, shall read it now."</p>

<p>"Say, mister, don't try to talk to her no more,"
whispered the boy, pulling Hook slyly by the
coat. "She always goes on like that when she
gets talking about these here things. It's my
opinion she's a little off."</p>

<p>"I'll read them carefully, and return them in
due time, my dear lady," replied the detective,
in a quiet tone, taking the hint. "What we
have to do now is to find out what's going on in
the room below if we can. It's my belief those
fellows are up to no good."</p>

<p>"You can just bet your life on that, Mr. Hook,"
whispered the newsboy. "They're concocting
a scheme to rob the Lispenard bank. I caught
on to it through the hole. Just you come over
here and listen for yerself. Look a-here, missus,
it's all right; you can just set down there and be
as quiet as you can. Him an' me'll attend to
this here business alone."</p>

<p>Sinking into a chair, the woman, burying her
face in her hands, began muttering wildly to
herself, while Jerry, taking the detective by the
arm, drew him toward the hole behind the
stove.</p>

<p>"There, boss, just you put your ear down
there," he whispered. "There's a hull raft of
them fellers down below, and them that busted
the vault of the Webster Bank's among 'em too.
I seed 'em an' I know 'em. I was a-tryin' fer to
foller 'em up meself fer ter help her along"&mdash;he
gave a jerk with his thumb toward the woman
behind them&mdash;"but since you've dropped onto
me an' are disposed to help, I'll just turn the
hull business over to you, fer you ought to understand
it better nor me."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Jerry," whispered Hook, throwing
himself flat upon his stomach and bending
over the hole in the floor, while the newsboy,
less clumsily, did the same.</p>

<p>Beneath, voices in earnest discussion could be
plainly heard; the voice of that pious and most
excellent man, Mr. Callister, being prominent
above the rest.</p>

<p>"And so it's fixed for the day after to-morrow.
We are to meet at Cagney's at eleven o'clock,
where I shall await your return from the bank
with a bigger haul, unless I'm greatly mistaken,
than we ever made before."</p>

<p>A look of triumph overspread the face of Caleb
Hook as those words, spoken in the voice of the
stock-broker, fell upon his ear.</p>

<p>"Jerry!" he whispered, softly.</p>

<p>"Well, boss?"</p>

<p>"Run around to the Oak street station and
tell Captain McGinty to send me five of his best
men without an instant's delay. Quiet now! Not
a particle of noise as you value your life."</p>

<p>"I'm fly, boss," whispered the boy, drawing
himself cautiously into an upright position.</p>

<p>As he did so his legs swept over the hole.</p>

<p>Crash! Bang!</p>

<p>A heavy body had fallen through the stove-pipe
hole, into the room below.</p>

<p>It was the iron stove-lifter, which a moment
before had rested quietly upon the floor by
Jerry's side.</p>

<p>In his movement to rise the legs of the boy
had come in contact with it, sweeping it across
the hole.</p>

<p>The intervening covering of thin paper was
broken on the instant.</p>

<p>With a loud crash the stove-lifter, sweeping
down through the opening, had fallen like a
bomb-shell into the midst of the men assembled
in the room below.</p>

<p>There was a sudden exclamation in the voice
of Callister.</p>

<p>Then all was as silent as the grave.</p>

<p>Like a flash Caleb Hook was upon his feet.</p>

<p>"Take care of her, Jerry," he whispered.
"Lock the door after me and open to no one. I
shall head them off at the front entrance. Great
Cæsar! how unfortunate! But I'll clap the
bracelets on that villain Callister even if the rest
escape."</p>

<p>He flung open the door and darted toward the
stairs, Jerry Buck locking it behind him as he
passed.</p>

<p>Scarce had he descended half the flight connecting
with the floor below, when a door was
suddenly flung open and four men sprang out
into the passage dimly illuminated by a single
hanging lamp.</p>

<p>"There he is!" exclaimed one of the men&mdash;the
smallest, in whom the detective instantly recognized
his companion on the force, Mr. Billy Cutts&mdash;"there's
the fellow who dropped us his card.
Gentlemen, this is my friend, Detective Hook.
He has come to pay us an evening call!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DETECTIVE IN A BAD FIX.</p>


<p>Detective Hook flung his hand behind him.</p>

<p>Instantly a revolver, grasped firmly between
his fingers, glittered in the rays of the hanging
lamp which shed its feeble light through the hall
of the Cherry street tenement in which he now
stood at bay.</p>

<p>"Stand off, there, you fellows!" he shouted,
sternly. "One step forward and some one bites
the dust!"</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>The warning was unheeded.</p>

<p>In the wild western towns the rule is, "Shoot
first and explanations afterward."</p>

<p>With fatal result Caleb Hook had chosen the
course in direct reverse of this.</p>

<p>With the quickness of thought&mdash;in fact, even as
the words had passed his lips, a short, thick-set
fellow, from the shelter of the doorway connecting
the passage with the room from which the
men had emerged, had drawn a revolver of the
smallest caliber and discharged it at the detective's
head.</p>

<p>It made no more noise than an ordinary popgun,
but, notwithstanding, accomplished its fatal
work.</p>

<p>A low cry escaped the lips of Caleb Hook. The
revolver dropped from his nerveless hand.</p>

<p>With one arm outstretched he clutched at the
banisters, missed them, clutched again, and
pitched headlong to the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Three cheers and a tiger for the man who
fired that shot!" whispered Callister, as all hands
crowded about the inanimate form of the fallen
man. "Sam Cutts, old man, there's some life
left in you yet. Now, what's to be done with
the carcass before the whole neighborhood comes
piling in?"</p>

<p>"Into the room with him&mdash;quick!" exclaimed
Billy Cutts. "We are safe there for a while, at
all events. We do not even know that he is
dead, meddling fool that he is."</p>

<p>His instructions were instantly obeyed.</p>

<p>The body of the unfortunate detective was
unceremoniously dragged into the room adjoining,
the door of which was immediately bolted
from within.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" asked Billy Cutts, hoarsely.
"By thunder, father, I suppose you had to do
it, but his death will kick up a Satan's own row
upon the force. The chief of police will never
rest night or day until he has run us down."</p>

<p>"Do it! Why, of course I had to do it!" replied
the elder Cutts&mdash;a grizzled reproduction of
his hopeful son in appearance. "It's my belief,
gents, that that there iron lifter dropped
down upon us by mistake. He knew it, and
was off to give us and the whole business away
to the captain of the nearest station before we
had time to escape."</p>

<p>"Sam's about right," growled Reuben Tisdale.
"I tell you, boys, this is a serious snap. We've
doctored this spy with a leaden pill, but who can
tell how many more of the same kind of cattle
there is in hiding in that room overhead? Who
lives up there, anyway? Does any one know?
Why were we not told of that stovepipe hole?"</p>

<p>"Blest if I know," said Callister. "Cutts,
you ought to be able to tell&mdash;these are your
rooms."</p>

<p>"Tell! I don't know no more about them
what lives in the house than the dead. I reckon
it would pay to have some on us slip up and
see."</p>

<p>"No, no!" whispered Callister, breathlessly.
"What's done is done, and can't be helped. It
is my opinion the whole scheme has been overheard
through that confounded hole in the floor."</p>

<p>"Hold on, you fellows," put in Billy Cutts.
"I'll go up-stairs and reconnoiter. I'm a detective,
don't you know, and if I catch on to anything
in the shape of the police I'll knock with
my heel once hard upon the floor. If you hear
the signal light out, every mother's son of you.
Of course they won't think anything strange at
seeing me come snooping round."</p>

<p>Silently unbolting the door, he crept up the
stairs, the others listening breathlessly for the
signal he proposed to give.</p>

<p>Through their own door&mdash;open on the crack&mdash;they
could hear Cutts open the door of the room
above.</p>

<p>Evidently he had met with no opposition, for
the sound of his footsteps could be heard overhead
walking about the room.</p>

<p>"Blame me if I don't think it was this cuss
that was up there alone, and no one else," muttered
the elder Cutts, indicating the detective,
who lay white and still, dead to all appearance,
in the midst of the little group.</p>

<p>"He's wrong, Lije," whispered Tisdale to the
stock-broker, who stood by his side, a little apart
from the rest. "I heard the footsteps of two
persons, at least, overhead there before that iron
thing came down. Luck has deserted us since
my&mdash;my&mdash;you know what. I'm doomed to be
the Jonah of the gang."</p>

<p>"Hush, Rube, for Heaven's sake! Can't you
let up on your infernal croaking even in a strait
like this? If the police are upon us, why, we'll
do the best thing that offers. If it's only this
fellow, Hook, why, Sam Cutts' bullet has settled
him. But not another word now. Here's Billy
coming back."</p>

<p>The young detective, if one so unfaithful to
his trust can truthfully be so termed, entered at
this moment with a smile of satisfaction on his
face.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he exclaimed, closing the
door. "There ain't a soul in the room up-stairs.
It's fixed up roughly to look like housekeeping,
but it's my belief that it was hired by Hook for
the simple purpose of catching us. It's a common
method with the profesh."</p>

<p>"Hadn't some one better inquire of the agent
on the first floor?" put in one of the men who
had not spoken before.</p>

<p>"Some other time will do for that," said Callister,
hurriedly. "What we want to do now is
to dispose of this body without further delay.
We can investigate later on."</p>

<p>"Well, and how do you propose to do it?"</p>

<p>"I rather guess we can fix that if we can
get it through the alley to the Donegal Shades&mdash;eh,
Rube?" replied the broker, with a smile.
"After we've finished with Mr. Hook, he'll trouble
us no more, I fancy. It's too bad to deprive
the New York police force of such a bright and
shining light, but then he had better have minded
his own affairs."</p>

<p>"So I say," growled another of the gang&mdash;a
rough-looking fellow. "These blamed detectives
don't give a hard working man no kinder
show."</p>

<p>"Better be sure he's actually croaked before
we bury him," grumbled Tisdale, in his characteristic
way.</p>

<p>"That's soon done," returned Callister. "I
guess I'm doctor enough for that."</p>

<p>He knelt beside the body and unbuttoned the
coat and vest.</p>

<p>Placing his ear upon the detective's breast, he
listened to the beating of the heart.</p>

<p>But the heart of Caleb Hook had apparently
ceased to beat. Nor did his pulse give sign of
any movement whatever.</p>

<p>"Dead as a door nail!" said the broker, laconically.
"Say, Sam Cutts, have you got such a
thing as a big bag?"</p>

<p>"No, an' you don't want it," answered Cutts.
"To carry that body down-stairs in a bag! You
must be crazy, man. That would never do at
all. We'll take him by the shoulders, two of us,
and drag him along as though he was blind
drunk&mdash;paralyzed, don't you see&mdash;then no one
will suspect anything at all."</p>

<p>"Good! That's the very scheme. Now, then,
gents, as it ain't always best for a man to know
too much, you had better say good-night, and
leave the management of this affair to Rube,
Cutts and myself. I feel sure that we have nothing
to be afraid of now, for I am confident that
this fellow was working alone. If I find that I
am wrong, some of us will notify you, you may
rest assured. Meanwhile, the appointment remains
the same as before, unless you hear to the
contrary&mdash;Cagney's sanctum, day after to-morrow
night."</p>

<p>Several of the men now silently withdrew,
leaving the two Cutts&mdash;father and son&mdash;Callister
and Tisdale with their victim.</p>

<p>The sound of their footsteps had scarce died
away upon the carpetless stairs when the stock-broker
spoke again.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Cutts, the elder; "I should
say we were."</p>

<p>"Then you slip round and give Pat the tip.
We mustn't lose a moment, once we start, and
you are to see that all is prepared."</p>

<p>Billy Cutts, opening the door cautiously, left
the room without a word.</p>

<p>For the space of perhaps ten minutes the three
men stood motionless, listening to every sound.</p>

<p>Overhead all was silent. There was no unusual
noise about the house.</p>

<p>"That pop of yours is a daisy, Sam," whispered
Callister. "It's my opinion that the report
of that shot was not heard on this floor. Come,
time's up. You take one arm, Rube, and I'll attend
to the other. Sam can give us a lift down
the stairs."</p>

<p>Two minutes later a peculiar but by no means
unusual sight might have been observed in the
alley leading from the side of the Cherry street
tenement through, by means of the gate pointed
out by Jerry Buck to Frank Mansfield, to the
rear of the Donegal Shades on Catherine street,
opposite the old market building.</p>

<p>It was two men dragging between them a
third, apparently in a state of helpless intoxication,
while a fourth man&mdash;a short, thick-set fellow&mdash;brought
up the rear.</p>

<p>If they were observed by any of the dwellers in
the adjoining tenements, it is safe to say that
their appearance attracted no attention at all, for
such sights are far too common in that part of
the city to excite even passing remark.</p>

<p>The passage of the alley was made in safety&mdash;the
gate was opened by Cutts&mdash;in another moment
they had entered the yard facing the residence
of the unfortunate Mrs. Marley, and in the
rear of the Donegal Shades.</p>

<p>Two men stood ready to receive them by the
side of a little flight of steps leading down to an
open cellar door.</p>

<p>One was Billy Cutts, the other P. Slattery, the
proprietor of the saloon, whose fiery shock of
hair betrayed his identity at a glance.</p>

<p>"All O. K., Pat?" said Callister, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"You're right, it is; run him down, an' I'm wid
yez in a jiffy. Begobs! if it ain't that fly detective
what shook me up on the Sunday morning
poor Mrs. Marley was murdered&mdash;an' phat ails
you, Mister Tisdale? Howly Mother, but you're
as white as though you'd seen a ghost!"</p>

<p>"Hold your jaw and lead the way!" muttered
the burglar, fiercely.</p>

<p>Slattery made no attempt at reply.</p>

<p>Running down the cellar steps, he motioned to
the others to follow without a word.</p>

<p>No sooner had they entered than he closed and
locked the door, and producing a match, lit a
lantern which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>"This way, gents," he said, briefly, advancing
through the cellar among a heterogeneous mass
of barrels and boxes and rubbish of all kinds.</p>

<p>Dragging the body of the detective between
them, the others followed.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man Slattery paused, and stooping
down, seized a great iron ring in the floor.</p>

<p>A trap-door was lifted, disclosing a dark opening
leading to unknown depths below, out of
which rushed a noisome stench causing the men
by its side to draw back with exclamations of disgust.</p>

<p>"Now, then, down wid him," whispered the
proprietor of the Donegal Shades. "It's as putty
a grave as wan might ax for. Drop him in, byes,
an' it's done nice an' handy, only there's niver a
praste to shrive him&mdash;worse luck. We must bury
the poor cuss widout book nor bell."</p>

<p>Raising the inanimate form of the detective
between them, Callister, Tisdale and Cutts dropped
it into the darkness of the open trap, while
P. Slattery, letting go the iron ring, jumped
heavily upon the lid.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">TREASURE HUNTING.</p>


<p>"Hey, you Garibaldi!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay! Alla righta!"</p>

<p>"Coast clear?"</p>

<p>"Beta your lifa!"</p>

<p>"Come on, then, fellers," said Barney, the
bootblack. "If it's all right outside, we may just
as well moosy along."</p>

<p>And the iron door of the old tomb set in the
wall on the Trinity church-yard opened and closed
with a bang&mdash;three "Bats in the Wall" stood
upon the street.</p>

<p>They were our old acquaintances, Barney the
bootblack and Sandy, the third being none other
than Frank Mansfield himself.</p>

<p>Instantly a fourth lad came running across
New Church street and joined them.</p>

<p>It proved to be Garibaldi, the Italian bat, who
had been sent out of the wall to reconnoiter and
report whether or no the coast was clear.</p>

<p>Evidently the "Bats" are bound upon some
expedition, for Barney carries a spade, to conceal
the true character of which a faint attempt
has been made by winding newspapers about its
blade; Sandy a similar package, while Frank
Mansfield has under his arm that which greatly
resembles a pick ax, tied up in a similar way.</p>

<p>To all outward appearance our hero stands
upon a social level with his companions, and
looks as little like Mr. Maxwell, Mr. Callister's
new clerk, as that individual looks like the young
man who was once assistant cashier of the Webster
National Bank.</p>

<p>One day has elapsed since the visit of Frank to
Miss Edna Callister at the house in Cottage
Place, upon which occasion, the reader will remember,
the missing parchment containing the
secret of the hiding-place of the treasure buried
by his grandfather was strangely placed in his
hands.</p>

<p>Upon further examination, the parchment
placed by the mysterious woman upon the window-sill
proved to be the document named in
the will of Jeremiah Mansfield.</p>

<p>Bidding farewell to the faithful girl&mdash;not, however,
without having promised to see her again
at the very first opportunity afforded him&mdash;Frank
hurried to the Police Headquarters, where at
this hour in the evening it sometimes happened
that Detective Hook could be found.</p>

<p>The parchment, which he studied carefully,
gave the most minute instructions as to where
the buried treasure could be found.</p>

<p>With his soul filled with triumph, Frank hurried
through the broad corridors of the Mulberry
street building and entered the office where Mr.
Hook was usually to be found when not engaged
on duty elsewhere.</p>

<p>He was all eagerness to tell of his discovery
and ask what, under the circumstances, had best
be done.</p>

<p>But Frank was doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>Caleb Hook had not been seen at headquarters
since the night before.</p>

<p>Nor did he appear next day.</p>

<p>Frank, employing the messenger boys of the
district telegraph freely, was unable to find the
slightest trace of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>Mr. Callister was at his office as usual, and appeared
more sleek and urbane than ever before.</p>

<p>He made no reference to the little affair at the
elevator, treating the disguised Mr. Maxwell with
even more politeness and consideration than was
ordinarily the case.</p>

<p>Considerably alarmed by the unexplained absence
of Detective Hook&mdash;doubly so from the
fact that he had neglected several most important
engagements that day&mdash;Frank resolved to
confide the situation in part to Barney the
Bootblack, and assisted by the Bats, whom he
had learned to trust fully as the rough but honest
lads that they were, to investigate the truth of
the statements contained in the parchment for
himself.</p>

<p>After the close of the day's business, therefore,
he paid a visit to the vault and arranged to start
upon their expedition that very night.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that we find the "Bats"
leaving the wall in the manner described just as
the clock of old Trinity rings out the hour of
twelve.</p>

<p>"Now, then, where's de place?" asked Barney,
as the four boys hurried along New Church
street in the direction of the Rector street station
of the Sixth avenue elevated road.</p>

<p>"It's at Fort Washington," replied Frank&mdash;"a
good mile beyond the 155th street station.
Up the steps, boys, and we'll start at once. Remember,
Barney, if I succeed in this undertaking
and in clearing my name before the world
the 'Bats in the Wall' will never have occasion
to regret their kindness to me."</p>

<p>An hour later the little party moving along
the Fort Washington road might have been seen
to steal quietly through the gateway leading up
to the half ruined mansion once the home of old
Jeremiah Mansfield, known as the Three Oaks.</p>

<p>The night was cold and cheerless&mdash;the wind
sighed mournfully among the trees of the park-like
inclosure&mdash;not a star was to be seen in the
clouded sky.</p>

<p>Pursuing their way up the avenue, the boys
came suddenly upon the house itself, standing
half ruined and deserted among the overshadowing
trees.</p>

<p>It was not without feelings of emotion that
Frank Mansfield gazed upon it.</p>

<p>Many and many were the pleasant hours spent
within the old mansion during the more prosperous
days of his boyhood&mdash;days not to be forgotten
so long as he lived.</p>

<p>And if that prosperity could be but in a measure
restored? If the name of his dead father, to
say nothing of his own, could but be cleared before
the world?</p>

<p>The finding of this money would place a powerful
weapon against the enemies surrounding
him at once in his hands.</p>

<p>No wonder that his soul burned with impatience
to grasp it. That he ought not to have
moved in the matter without first consulting Detective
Hook he instinctively felt, and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But the impatience of youth is proverbial&mdash;than
that no more need be said.</p>

<p>Familiar with the premises from boyhood,
Frank, making no effort to enter the house by the
regular way, and conducting his companions to
the rear of the building, removed without difficulty
a small window sash set in the wall close
to the ground.</p>

<p>A moment later the four boys stood in the
great cellar beneath Three Oaks, gazing about
them by the light of a lantern which he carried in
his hand.</p>

<p>It was festooned with cobwebs and green with
mold. The floor was littered with boxes, old
barrels, and rubbish of every sort.</p>

<p>Frank, setting the lantern upon a box, turned
to Sandy and Garibaldi, who, not having been
informed as to the nature of the undertaking in
which they had engaged, were looking about
them in a decidedly mystified way.</p>

<p>Barney he had taken into confidence, leaving
him to tell the other "bats" what he pleased.</p>

<p>Having now reached the scene of their labors,
however, it seemed necessary to make some explanation
to these boys, who had come willingly
with Barney to help him, and he accordingly
briefly informed them of what he was about to
do.</p>

<p>The eyes of the two boys open wildly.</p>

<p>"What! diga for golda?" exclaimed Garibaldi,
in surprise.</p>

<p>"That's the size of it, boys, and it belongs to
me by rights. How, it would take too long to explain;
but help me out, and I promise that you
shall have your share."</p>

<p>"You beta we willa!" cried the little Italian,
throwing aside his jacket and seizing one of the
spades. "Showa whera diga, I finda him, donta
forget it."</p>

<p>Sandy likewise gave full assent.</p>

<p>"Then listen, boys," said Frank, pulling a paper
from his pocket, and holding it up to the
lantern on the box&mdash;it was a copy of a portion of
the contents of the parchment&mdash;"this will tell us
what to do."</p>

<p>He read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Descend to the cellar. Measure ten feet from
the north chimney, then five due west. Here a
flat stone will be found, beneath which the treasure
lies. It is for my grandson if he be found
worthy, for my friend, Elijah Callister, if he is
not. If it shall fall into the hands of Frank
Mansfield, let him so dispose of it as to shed luster
upon the name he bears.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Jeremiah Mansfield.</span>
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Three Oaks</span>, January 1, 1879."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Now for it, boys!" he exclaimed, excitedly.
"This is the cellar, and we are here ready to
work. Barney, the tape-line. Lay over to that
chimney, now, while I run out ten feet."</p>

<p>The distance was measured off and marked
upon the cellar floor.</p>

<p>"Now, then, five feet to the west. That's the
idea! By gracious! here's the flat stone just as
the paper says!"</p>

<p>It was as Frank had said.</p>

<p>Buried in the earth which composed the cellar
floor a flat stone of a grayish color was discovered,
above which all now stood.</p>

<p>"The spades, Barney and Sandy!" cried
Frank, seizing the pick-ax himself. "Hold the
light, Garibaldi, that we may see what we are
about. Make what noise you like, boys, there's
no one to hear us&mdash;this house has been deserted
for years."</p>

<p>He struck the ground with the pick-ax as he
spoke, the sound echoing upon the rafters of the
floor above.</p>

<p>The earth once loosened, Barney and Sandy
made short work of it with their spades.</p>

<p>It was of a light and sandy character, and
yielded so readily to their efforts that Frank,
finding the pick-ax useless, soon threw it to one
side, and taking the spade from the hands of
Sandy, joined Barney in the hole, now rapidly
deepening.</p>

<p>Both boys had removed their coats, and were
working with a will.</p>

<p>Around them the little mound of earth thrown
out by their spades steadily grew, until a depth
of four feet or more was reached.</p>

<p>And yet, they had found nothing. Nor was
there any appearance that the earth had been
ever disturbed.</p>

<p>"By thunder, but this is tough work!" growled
Barney, straightening himself up. "How
much further do you think we've got to go?"</p>

<p>"It is impossible to tell," answered Frank,
working away vigorously. "It may be one foot,
it may be ten&mdash;&mdash; By gracious! here's something
now. I've just struck it with my spade."</p>

<p>A sharp, ringing sound was heard. The spade
had struck something of a metallic nature at
the bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>"I've found it, boys," he cried, in great excitement,
stooping down and with his hands
brushing back the loose earth from the lid of a
great iron chest at the bottom of the hole. "The
treasure is mine&mdash;mine at last! Let that wretched
Callister now beware!"</p>

<p>"And 'that wretched Callister' bids you say
your prayers, young man!" cried a deep voice
behind them. "In digging that hole you have
dug your grave. Prepare to lie in it now."</p>

<p>The four boys sprang back, Frank leaping from
the hole.</p>

<p>There, amid the old boxes and barrels in the
dim light, the forms of two men could be seen
with cocked revolvers pointed&mdash;one directly at
the head of Barney, the bootblack, the other at
the head of Frank.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MYSTERY OF TRINITY CHURCH-YARD EXPLAINED
AT LAST.</p>


<p>At the sight of Elijah Callister and his companion
standing before him with cocked pistols
in their hands amid the shadows of the cellar,
Frank Mansfield sprang from the hole in which
he stood.</p>

<p>Seizing the pick-ax, he advanced bravely toward
the man who long had been the persecutor
of himself and his afflicted family, heedless of the
glittering muzzles of the revolvers pointed directly
at his head.</p>

<p>Barney the Bootblack, Garibaldi and Sandy
had meanwhile sought refuge among the boxes
and barrels, the little Italian making the cellar
ring again with his cries of fear.</p>

<p>"Shoot, if you dare, Elijah Callister!" cried
Frank, with proudly curling lip. "You helped
to kill my father, you drove my mother mad.
Murder me, if you dare! There is justice for
such as you. As God hears me, it will descend
swift and sure upon your sinful head."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Lije," whispered the man by his
side. "There are three of them&mdash;we can't kill
them all. By Heaven! the lad is right, there
has been murder enough. Beside, he is my
nephew, poor Helen's son, and I say he shan't be
killed!"</p>

<p>It was Reuben Tisdale, the burglar, the husband
of the dead Mrs. Marley, by whose hand
that unfortunate creature came to her untimely
end in the little house in the rear of the Donegal
Shades.</p>

<p>As he spoke these words, with one blow he
struck the pistol from the hands of Elijah Callister,
his own hand falling to his side.</p>

<p>"Meddling fool!" cried the broker, fiercely,
springing upon him. "The treasure for which
we have risked so much lies uncovered before us
at last, and now you would spoil it all! That
boy must die or we are ruined! I tell you he
has been a spy upon us; he has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! He is my son, Elijah Callister, and he
shall live! Harm one hair of his head at the
peril of your life!"</p>

<p>Through the dark passages of the cellar the
words resounded.</p>

<p>Instantly there burst upon the scene a blaze
of light.</p>

<p>It rested upon the boxes and barrels, it fell
upon the cobweb-hung beams overhead, and,
glancing back, lit up the faces of Callister, Tisdale
and Frank with a strange, unearthly glare.</p>

<p>With a loud cry the bank burglar, heedless of
the blow aimed at him by his infuriated companion,
sprang back.</p>

<p>"Lije! Lije! Look! look! It is Maria's ghost
again!" he cried, frantically, clapping his hands
before his face to shut out the light which met
his gaze.</p>

<p>Before them standing by the side of the hole
in which the buried treasure lay hidden, was the
form of the mysterious woman who had played
so stirring a part in this tale.</p>

<p>With one warning finger outstretched before
her she glided forward and placed her form in
front of Frank.</p>

<p>"Go, vile wretches!" she fiercely cried. "Go
and work evil no more to me and mine! May
Heaven's vengeance fall upon you both for your
many crimes."</p>

<p>For an instant Elijah Callister stood regarding
her with set teeth and eyes filled with snake-like
glittering.</p>

<p>As he did so a mist seemed to rise before them,
obscuring the woman and the youth, who now
held her clasped tightly in his arms, from view.</p>

<p>And the light increased.</p>

<p>Through the cellar a loud crackling noise was
heard as the light increased.</p>

<p>One glance behind him explained the sounds.</p>

<p>The rubbish which filled the cellar had burst
out into a sheet of flame.</p>

<p>"It's all up with us, Rube, curses on your
folly!" he whispered fiercely, as, grasping by the
collar the man who had crouched cowering by
his side, he dragged him toward the cellar
stairs.</p>

<p>"Fire! Fire! Oh! missus! I've dropped the
pan! and the hull business is a-burnin' up!"</p>

<p>Out from among the burning rubbish sprang a
frightened boy.</p>

<p>It was Jerry Buck, with every hair standing
up in horror, his jacket all ablaze.</p>

<p>"Take her through the window, boys!" cried
Frank, springing toward the fleeing men. "Save
her and save yourselves while I deal with these
villains fate has thrown into my hands!"</p>

<p>He sprang toward Callister and seized him by
the collar of his coat.</p>

<p>Too late!</p>

<p>With a sudden twist the stock-broker jerked
himself free, and leaving the coat in the hands of
Frank, had followed Reuben Tisdale up the cellar
stairs.</p>

<p>To attempt to follow them was useless.</p>

<p>A wall of seething flames, bursting forth from
the rubbish of years accumulated beneath the
stairs, now intervened.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Barney and Sandy had assisted
the woman through the open window, gaining
a place of safety without, while little Garibaldi
was bravely but vainly endeavoring to pull the
burning jacket from the back of Jerry Buck that
he might be able to escape.</p>

<p>All attempt to follow Callister was useless.</p>

<p>Frank saw that at a glance.</p>

<p>"Let him go," he muttered. "Heaven will
deal with him according to his deserts. After
all, I cannot harm him, for he is the father of
the girl I love."</p>

<p>He sprang toward Jerry, and wrapping the
coat left in his hands by the fleeing stock broker
about him, thus smothering the flames, drew him
hastily through the cellar window, Garibaldi,
the Italian, following with all possible speed.</p>

<p>The mysterious woman, Barney and Sandy
stood upon the snow covered ground awaiting
them.</p>

<p>With a low cry of joy the woman threw herself
into Frank Mansfield's arms.</p>

<p>"My son&mdash;my darling boy!" she cried, wildly
kissing his cheeks and stroking his hair. "Thank
God I hold you in my arms once more! I have
sought to prove your innocence, and though I
have so far failed, come what will, we must not
part again."</p>

<p>As she spoke these words behind the little
group the roaring of the flames increased.</p>

<p>From the window of the first floor of the old
mansion they now burst forth, illuminating the
landscape for yards around.</p>

<p>"Mother, can this indeed be you?" cried
Frank, gazing upon the worn features of the
woman in mingled astonishment and surprise.</p>

<p>"It is, my son. And did you think me dead?"</p>

<p>"I most certainly did. I left you beneath the
church-yard wall when&mdash;when I went into the
bank. When I came out you were gone, and
next morning I saw that which I could have
sworn was your dead body lying in a house in
Catherine street in the rear of a place they call
the Donegal Shades."</p>

<p>The woman smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"Listen, Frank," she said, with more calmness
than she had before displayed. "Listen to my
story, to be told in a few brief words, and you
will understand this mystery which has been
puzzling you for weeks."</p>

<p>Here Barney was seen to glance at Jerry Buck,
who stood quietly by, still wrapped in Mr. Callister's
coat.</p>

<p>Neither spoke, however, and Frank stood
breathlessly listening to what his mother was
about to tell.</p>

<p>"I escaped from the asylum where Mr. Callister
had placed me," began the unfortunate Mrs.
Mansfield, "some weeks since as you know.
I had been mad, but was so no longer, although
no one would believe me when I told them so.
My first care was to look for you, my son. With
sorrow I heard of your dissipation and wrong-doing,
and knowing well the interest Mr. Callister
had at stake in leading you into crime, I determined
to watch over you in secret and save you
if I could. But this was after the time when, in
desperation at what I had heard, I attempted to
commit suicide by jumping into the river, from
which I was rescued by this brave boy, known to
you as Jerry Buck, but instantly recognized by
me as the outcast son of my unfortunate twin
sister, Maria Tisdale, the wife of that man who a
moment ago stood in the cellar of yonder burning
house by Elijah Callister's side. Stop! Do
not interrupt me!" she exclaimed, seeing that
Frank was about to speak. "A crowd will
gather here before many minutes. Before it
comes we must be far away. I knew the lad's
features at a glance, and I told him who and
what I was. In return he took me to the home
of the 'Bats' in the old tomb beneath the church-yard
wall.</p>

<p>"On the night of the bank robbery I followed
you from the time you left Mr. Callister's office
until I spoke to you in the street by the side of
the fence which surrounds the grave-yard of
Trinity Church.</p>

<p>"You would not heed my warning&mdash;you left
me in the hands of those two young ruffians
while you entered the bank to do the wrong into
which you had been led by that young villain,
Cutts, whom I knew to be a thief and an associate
of thieves.</p>

<p>"No sooner had you entered than Cutts sprang
back, and joining the two young men who had
held me down, all three ran off down Rector
street and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile I slipped across the street and
crawled beneath an empty truck, determined to
follow you in secret the instant you appeared.</p>

<p>"There I found this good boy, Barney, who
told me of the bank robbery and just how it had
occurred. He had with him the tin box, also,
which the burglars had dropped in the street.
Examining the papers I recognized your grandfather's
will at a glance.</p>

<p>"This I left with Barney, with instructions to
give it to you, while I took the parchment myself,
that by no combination of circumstances
might it be lost.</p>

<p>"It was by my directions that Barney rescued
you and took you into the vault, and when I
knew you were safe I started to meet my unfortunate
sister, Mrs. Tisdale&mdash;who had long been
suffering from insanity from the brutal treatment
of her husband&mdash;whom I had just succeeded in
finding upon the morning of the day in which
these events occurred.</p>

<p>"At the corner of Rector street and Broadway
I met Detective Hook.</p>

<p>"He followed me, but at Park Row and
Frankfort street, seeing my sister, who exactly
resembled me, awaiting me, I slipped away
while his eyes were for the moment turned, and
saw him following her in my stead."</p>

<p>"Then it was she who was murdered?" cried
Frank, lost in wonder and surprise.</p>

<p>"It was," replied Mrs. Mansfield, sadly.
"Murdered beyond all doubt by the husband
who drove her mad and made her life a curse."</p>

<p>"And he's the man I'll hang, even if he is my
father!" exclaimed Jerry Buck, who, with whitened
features and firmly-set teeth, had been listening
attentively to the woman's tale.</p>

<p>"See here," he added, stretching out his hand
in which a bundle of papers was grasped. "I've
been looking at these 'ere while you two have
been talking, an' can read well enough to know
that they'll give me the grip on him an' his
pal."</p>

<p>"Where did you find them?" cried Frank,
eagerly.</p>

<p>He had seized the papers from Jerry Buck,
and hastily examined them in the light of the
burning house from which the flames were now
pouring, illuminating the surrounding scene
with the brightness of day.</p>

<p>They were small, but well-executed plans of
the vaults of the Lispenard Bank, all marked
"duplicate," and bearing upon them Elijah Callister's
name.</p>

<p>"Where did I find them?" cried the boy.
"Why, in the pocket of this here coat to be sure.
Come, we must take 'em to the chief of police.
If they ain't the fixin' of him what killed my
mother an' the feller what's runnin' you down
to earth, why, it won't be for want of tryin' on
the part of the 'Bats in the Wall'&mdash;that's all I've
got to say."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">ELIJAH CALLISTER ADDS STILL ANOTHER CRIME
TO THE LIST.</p>


<p>It was well on toward three o'clock in the
morning when P. Slattery, the red-headed proprietor
of the Donegal Shades, was aroused from
his sleep in the back room behind his saloon by
a loud knocking upon the outer door.</p>

<p>"Now who the blazes can that be?" he muttered.
"It's too early for the market-men, I'm
sure. Must be some drunken tramp who hain't
got full enough widout disturbin' an honest man
in his bed. Go way wid yez, ye spalpeen! It's
not Pat Slattery that'll open the dure for yez the
night."</p>

<p>Thump&mdash;thump&mdash;thump!</p>

<p>Upon the door the knocks were rained with
redoubled strength.</p>

<p>"Begorra, an' I'm afeard it's break me dure in
he'll be after doin'," muttered the saloon-keeper,
tumbling sleepily out of bed.</p>

<p>He crept across the darkened bar-room, and
pulling aside the curtains cautiously, peered out
into the deserted street.</p>

<p>Two men stood without.</p>

<p>P. Slattery recognized in their faces Messrs.
Callister and Tisdale at a glance.</p>

<p>The stock-broker was in his shirt sleeves and
hatless. He was shivering with the cold, while
Reuben Tisdale, pale and haggard, stood to
one side with his eyes fixed upon the ground.</p>

<p>The sound of the movement at the curtain,
slight as it had been, had not escaped Mr. Callister's
ears.</p>

<p>"Open the door, Pat, for God's sake!" he
whispered, pressing his face to the glass.
"Rube's gone crazy, I think, and I'm almost
perished with the cold."</p>

<p>"Be the pipers! an's there's suthin' gone
wrong!" muttered the saloon-keeper. "It's the
ould boy himself that's to pay, I'm afeard."</p>

<p>He hastily undid the fastening of the door.</p>

<p>Callister and Tisdale entered the saloon.</p>

<p>"Some whisky, quick, Pat," exclaimed the
former, his teeth chattering as he spoke. "We
have had Satan's own time of it getting here,
and you must give us a shake down for the balance
of the night."</p>

<p>"An' I'll do that same wid pleasure, Mr. Callister,"
cried the Irishman, with the good nature
proverbial of his race, as he bustled behind the
bar. "Howly mother! but yer gills is as blue
as indigo. What happened ye that ye lost the
coat an' the hat?"</p>

<p>"It's a story that'll take too long to tell, Pat.
There, that's better"&mdash;he had emptied the glass
of raw spirits at a gulp. "Now show us where
we can sleep."</p>

<p>"It's no use, Lije," said Tisdale gloomily.
"You had best light out and save yourself while
you can. I shall have no peace until poor Maria's
death is avenged. I'm going now to give myself
up to the police; to see the spirit of my murdered
wife again would kill me. I can't stand it
any longer and I won't. As I told you before,
I'm the Jonah of the gang."</p>

<p>The eyes of Elijah Callister blazed with evil
light.</p>

<p>"You are, eh?" he hissed between his tightly
set teeth. "So you are going to give yourself
up, and ruin your friends, you soft-hearted fool&mdash;you
man of putty&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash; Ain't it
enough to have lost these plans, to have gone
through what we have, without&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, backed toward the bar, and, glaring
at his companion, leaned heavily against it.</p>

<p>Unseen by either Slattery or Tisdale, his hand
stole behind him like a flash, grasping a large
cheese-knife which lay upon the bar of the
"Donegal Shades," carelessly left there by the
proprietor himself after cutting up the free lunch
which it was his custom each night to spread.</p>

<p>"Is your mind made up, Reuben Tisdale?
Will no argument bring you to reason? Speak&mdash;you
had best be quick."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I am resolved to do it, Lije, no matter
what you say. I tell you still again I can't help
it; I'm doomed to be the Jonah of the gang."</p>

<p>He stood dejectedly by the stove, his eyes fixed
upon the sanded floor.</p>

<p>With measured step the man at the bar advanced
toward him, one hand still held behind
his back.</p>

<p>"And do you know what the men on the ship
did to Jonah?" he hissed. "No? Then I'll tell
you&mdash;they threw him overboard, as I now throw
you, Reuben Tisdale, and the pit beneath this
house, which already numbers its victims by the
score, is the whale, and will swallow up the
Jonah of the gang to which you and I belong,
and you can bet your sweet life that from out of
the depths of that whale's belly you'll never
come forth to give my secrets away!"</p>

<p>The words had not fully left his lips when
with a sudden spring, his now upraised hand descended,
and Reuben Tisdale fell to the floor
with a groan.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And while these events are transpiring how
fares it with our old friend, Mr. Detective Hook.</p>

<p>"Why, he is dead!" did we hear some one exclaim?</p>

<p>Not at all.</p>

<p>Detectives, as a race, are hard to kill, and
Caleb Hook offers no exception to his class!</p>

<p>Beneath the cellar of the Donegal Shades lies
that brave man, neither dead nor helpless, but
able to stand erect and move about, eagerly
longing to escape.</p>

<p>And no wonder.</p>

<p>The foul pit in which he found himself confined
was damp and slimy&mdash;filled with a thousand
noisome smells.</p>

<p>For an hour and more after the body of the unconscious
detective had been dropped through
the trap-door by Callister and Cutts he remained
lying unconscious upon the muddy floor of the
place into which he had fallen, an old sub-cellar,
used in former days by the occupants of the building,
but long since abandoned on account of its
dampness and from the fact that it was filled to
the brim with the water of the East River at
every tide rising above the usual height.</p>

<p>But Caleb Hook was not dead.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>By a merciful Providence the ball from the
burglar's pistol, missing by a hair's breadth a vital
part, touched a certain nerve, well understood
by the medical profession, glanced from the accompanying
muscle and buried itself in a fleshy
spot, leaving its victim in a state of suspended
animation, practically unharmed.</p>

<p>Its action upon that nerve spent, and the eyes
of Caleb Hook opened to life once more.</p>

<p>Where he was or how he came there were two
questions which he was unable to decide.</p>

<p>Matches which he always carried soon revealed
to him the nature of the place&mdash;damp, foul-smelling
cellar that it was, with the only outlet the
trap-door through which he had fallen, a good
five feet above his head.</p>

<p>Beyond a feeling of great weakness, he felt
neither fear nor pain.</p>

<p>That he had been thrown there as dead he understood
perfectly well, and yet&mdash;brave heart that
he was&mdash;he refused to banish hope.</p>

<p>The hours passed.</p>

<p>Caleb Hook has exhausted every means to reach
that trap above him, but in vain.</p>

<p>Crouched in a corner we see him now, his head
buried in his hands.</p>

<p>Through the foul place the rats scurry past,
but he heeds them not&mdash;his thoughts are upon
the strange case in following which he has come
to this living death.</p>

<p>The robbery of the Webster bank&mdash;the following
of the strange woman&mdash;the murder of Mrs.
Marley and her singular reappearance in the
church-yard later on, passed one after another
in hopeless procession through his mind.</p>

<p>The capture of the burglar, Joe Dutton, the
man who dropped the dollars at the Catherine
Market&mdash;whom we should have stated before was
arrested by a policeman on Cherry street before
he had run a dozen yards&mdash;and his untimely
death also rose up before him.</p>

<p>That he had been poisoned by his associates in
crime the detective could not doubt.</p>

<p>And the thought gave him no courage.</p>

<p>If these scoundrels had no mercy to share to
their own what hope was there for him?</p>

<p>Hark! What sound was that?</p>

<p>Surely there are footsteps walking on the floor
above?</p>

<p>Springing to his feet he stares wildly at the
trap-door above his head.</p>

<p>It moves! It opens! But alas! it opens not
in aid to him!</p>

<p>There is a low murmuring of voices, and suddenly
the body of a large and powerful man
drops through the open trap, falling heavily at
the detective's feet.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE JONAH.</p>


<p>As the body of the falling man struck the
slimy floor of the old sub-cellar beneath the
Donegal Shades, Detective Hook sprang back
against the damp and dripping wall.</p>

<p>It was well that he did so.</p>

<p>With a heavy thud the man fell at his feet
half buried in the foul and pasty mud.</p>

<p>Instantly the trap-door was heard to close
above him, followed by the sound of feet moving
away.</p>

<p>"Oh, God&mdash;oh, God, have mercy on my sinful
soul! Must I die here like a dog?"</p>

<p>From the man at his feet the sound went forth.</p>

<p>Caleb Hook kneeled by his side.</p>

<p>"Courage, friend!" he whispered. "Courage!
God may help us yet!"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;ah! Keep off&mdash;keep off!" shrieked the
dying man. "Is not one ghost enough to haunt
me, that the voice of the man I helped to bury in
this devil's den must come ringing in my ears?
Keep off, I say! Detective Hook, I know your
voice! I did not raise a hand to kill you! You
know it well enough!"</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>The last match possessed by the detective is
lighted&mdash;he holds it to the face before him.</p>

<p>"Reuben Tisdale, you, the most successful
maker of burglars' tools known among the crooks
of New York!"</p>

<p>The man raised himself with difficulty, gazing
with wild, staring eyes upon the detective's face.</p>

<p>"Alive&mdash;alive!" he gasped. "It is hours
since we threw you here, dead, as we all supposed."</p>

<p>"But I still live, Reuben Tisdale, and so perhaps
may you. Answer, man! Beside that trap-door
overhead, is there no way out of this?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," murmured the burglar, sinking
back upon the muddy floor. "There is a secret
passage, and you shall escape; for me there is
no hope; Callister has settled me; foul fiend
that he is. But I will be revenged&mdash;I swear it!
I will tell the truth, as I hope to meet my poor
wife above. Ha&mdash;ha! Elijah Callister, did I not
speak the truth? There is fate in this&mdash;it is
written that I should live to be the Jonah of the
crowd!"</p>

<p>"Speak!" cried the detective. "Show me the
way out of this and I will save you if it costs my
life!"</p>

<p>"No, no," moaned the dying man. "It's
no use&mdash;it's all up with Rube Tisdale at last, but
you shall be saved: the secret passage leading
from this place can be opened by a pressure of
hand. It shall be opened, and you shall live,
it is within my reach to do it, even as I lay here
now."</p>

<p>"Then do it! Do one good action before you
die."</p>

<p>"I will, do not fear, but listen first to the confession
of a dying man."</p>

<p>"Speak, I am listening," said the detective,
quietly, raising the head of the sufferer and supporting
it on his arm.</p>

<p>"Caleb Hook," began the burglar. "I am a
man of many evil deeds. Listen to the story of
my life."</p>

<p>"In my youth I was a machinist; I had two
friends; Frank Mansfield was the name of one,
Elijah Callister, the other.</p>

<p>"Our home was in the upper part of New
York, now known as High Bridge.</p>

<p>"Near us lived two twin sisters, beautiful
girls, both. Their names were Helen and Maria
Dupont.</p>

<p>"I married Maria, my friend Mansfield Helen,
and then the trouble began.</p>

<p>"Little by little, by Callister I was led into
crime, and for years we have worked together,
he making plans for burglaries, I furnishing the
tools and assisting to carry them out.</p>

<p>"Frank Mansfield&mdash;I speak now of the father
of the lad you know by that name&mdash;would not
join us. In fact, he never suspected Callister,
although he knew well what I was about myself.</p>

<p>"Time passed and he prospered, our families
were separated and never met.</p>

<p>"Callister hated him. He had himself loved
Helen Dupont, and when she married Mansfield
swore to be avenged.</p>

<p>"By trickery and device he so worked upon
Mansfield's father as to cause him to make a
singular will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," interrupted the detective, "I
know all about that, you need not stop to explain."</p>

<p>"Do you? It may be so, but you do not know
that it was Callister and myself who killed old
Jeremiah Mansfield in his bed hoping to gain the
buried treasure which we never found. You do
not know that we robbed Mansfield's store of the
funds intrusted to his care, and casting suspicion
upon him drove his wife mad as was mine already,
and sent him with a blackened name down
to a defaulter's grave.</p>

<p>"We did that, Caleb Hook, and more. We
robbed the Webster bank, and concocted the
conspiracy to throw the burden of that crime on
Frank Mansfield's son, the lad arrested by you."</p>

<p>"And you did all this," said the detective,
sternly. "Reuben Tisdale, you are justly punished,
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush! If that were all I might still
wish to live.</p>

<p>"Listen, for my breath grows short. You saw
a woman dead in an upper room in the house in
the rear of this evil den?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Mrs. Marley&mdash;what of her?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Marley was not her name. She was
Maria Tisdale&mdash;my wife. Detective Hook, it was
my hand that struck her down. I did it in anger,
God forgive me, poor insane creature that
she was. I saw her hovering about the Webster
bank&mdash;I thought she had found in the street certain
papers which I dropped, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you killed her?"</p>

<p>"I did; I&mdash;ah! Take her off! take her off!
There she is bending over me! Her hand is above
my throat now!"</p>

<p>"Hush! hush!" whispered the detective.
"There is no one here but ourselves.</p>

<p>"My God, the man is dying!" he exclaimed, as
the eyes of Reuben Tisdale closed and the head
rested more heavily on his arm.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;still live."</p>

<p>The words came faintly from the parted lips.</p>

<p>"Drag me to the wall&mdash;there&mdash;right&mdash;behind&mdash;you.
Stop&mdash;them&mdash;they rob the&mdash;Lispenard bank&mdash;at&mdash;twelve&mdash;to-night.
Callister&mdash;made plans&mdash;I&mdash;revenge&mdash;revenge&mdash;oh!
God have mercy on
my sinful soul!"</p>

<p>They were the last words of Reuben Tisdale on
earth.</p>

<p>Even as they were uttered, dragged across the
slimy floor of the cellar by the detective, he
stretched forth his hand and pressed a groove in
what appeared to be a wall of solid stone.</p>

<p>It moved, it opened, a door flew back, displaying
a dark and narrow passage at the very moment
the man breathed his last.</p>

<p>Laying him gently down. Caleb Hook, trembling
with weakness and excitement, moved toward
the secret passage now disclosed.</p>

<p>"Saved&mdash;saved!" he murmured, faintly.
"Means of escape are open before me, but&mdash;oh,
God! how weak I am! This mist before my
eyes&mdash;this trembling in my limbs! I&mdash;I&mdash;help&mdash;oh,
help!"</p>

<p>The "Jonah" has spoken.</p>

<p>Have his revelations come too late?</p>

<p>Apparently, for the trembling form of Caleb
Hook sinks lifeless across the very entrance to
the secret passage.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A FRUSTRATED CRIME&mdash;THE END.</p>


<p>Since the startling events at the Three Oaks,
terminating with the complete destruction of
that gloomy old mansion by fire, another day
has passed, and night has settled down upon the
city of New York once more.</p>

<p>It has been an eventful day for many, no
doubt; of its events for our hero, Frank Mansfield,
his mother restored to reason and the world,
and his faithful friends, the "Bats in the Wall,"
we have no time to speak.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the virtuous Mr. Callister appeared
at his office as usual, and figured prominently in
several large transactions on the floor of the
Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>The new clerk, Mr. Maxwell, however, did not
appear at the office, nor had Detective Hook
been seen by any one.</p>

<p>The police authorities, now thoroughly alarmed
by his continued absence, caused a general alarm
to be sent out, and during the entire day his
brother detectives searched for him in all directions,
but in vain.</p>

<p>Now, upon the night of the day in question,
had any one chanced to stand upon the bulkhead
of the East river front at a point somewhere between
Catherine street and the Market slip, they
might have observed a man of most singular appearance
creep apparently out of the solid wall
of the bulkhead itself, and, with evident effort,
leap to the deck of a little sloop lying within
arm's-length of the street line.</p>

<p>Once upon the deck of the sloop, he did not
pause, but seizing the string-piece of the bulkhead,
drew himself to the ground above, and
standing erect, gave vent to a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>And no wonder.</p>

<p>From head to foot he was a mass of dripping
mud.</p>

<p>"Safe&mdash;safe at last!" he muttered; "safe and
free to act once more. It still lacks something
of twelve&mdash;if my strength holds out I may make
it yet. I will make it. Let Elijah Callister beware,
for the day of his reckoning at last has
come."</p>

<p>Turning abruptly he crossed South street and
disappeared in the dark shadows of the great
warehouses which cluster around the East river
shore.</p>

<p>Who is this man who swears vengeance upon
so worthy, so pious a member of society as Mr.
Elijah Callister of the Tenth Baptist Church?</p>

<p>His name is Caleb Hook.</p>

<p>His business is that of a police detective.</p>

<p>Reuben Tisdale was right.</p>

<p>Out of the whale's belly the avenger has come.</p>

<p>Fate had indeed willed that he should prove
the Jonah of the band.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Now, then, Billy, you slip up the steps and
try the door. If the watchman has not gone
back on us, it ought to open at the first touch."</p>

<p>Before the Lispenard Bank stood three men,
well disguised in great coats and low slouch
hats, one carrying a small grip-sack in his hand.</p>

<p>They are Elijah Callister and the two Cutts&mdash;father
and son.</p>

<p>It is the stock broker who speaks, and Billy
Cutts, the renegade detective, is the one who
creeps up the steps of the Lispenard Bank in
obedience to his command.</p>

<p>"Is it all right, Billy?" whispered Cutts, the
elder. "We want to get off the street as soon
as we possibly can."</p>

<p>"All right, dad, come on."</p>

<p>The two men moved stealthily toward the steps
of the bank.</p>

<p>"Squeak! squeak! squeak!"</p>

<p>Behind them a low, bat-like cry went up for
one instant only, and then all was still.</p>

<p>"What the deuce was that?" whispered Callister,
drawing back in alarm.</p>

<p>For the space of a minute all three stood motionless,
Billy Cutts at the top of the steps, Callister
and Cutts the elder at the foot.</p>

<p>The street was utterly deserted.</p>

<p>Nor was this strange.</p>

<p>Lower New York is always deserted at night,
and the hour of twelve had already passed.</p>

<p>Before them rose the grim stone walls of the
Custom House on William street&mdash;that upon
which the Lispenard bank is situated&mdash;from Wall
to Beaver, as far as the eye could reach, not a
living thing could be seen.</p>

<p>"Come on; it's only a blasted bat!" whispered
Billy Cutts, from the top of the steps.
"We have no time to fool away, I tell you.
First thing we know a cop will be along. The
goose is ready for the plucking, and we want to
be about it. It's blame strange Rube didn't
show up!"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind him!" answered Callister,
hastily. "Probably he's off on some other lay.
Open the door, Billy, and we are with you. We
must and shall put this job through successfully.
There's enough in that vault to make us all independent
for life!"</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;go on, you make too much talk,"
whispered Sam Cutts, leading the way up the
steps. "Lead on there, Billy, if the door is
open. We've nothing to fear."</p>

<p>Billy Cutts opened the door softly without reply.</p>

<p>Followed by his companions, he entered the
bank.</p>

<p>"Hey, Mike!" he whispered, hoarsely.</p>

<p>It was the bank watchman he called who,
faithless to his trust, had been bribed to assist
them in their work.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>Within the bank all was dark; by the feeble
rays of the street lamp without the outlines of
the desks could be just discerned.</p>

<p>"Hey, Mike! Mike!" whispered Billy Cutts
again, stealthily advancing.</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left his lips, than
through the interior of the Lispenard Bank there
shot out a blaze of light.</p>

<p>"Throw up your hands, there!" cried a stern
voice before them. "Up with them, or you are
dead men!"</p>

<p>With a low cry, Elijah Callister sprang toward
the door.</p>

<p>Before them, in the full blaze of the lighted
gas, stood Frank Mansfield and five policemen
at his side, with glittering revolvers in their outstretched
hands, aimed directly at the burglars'
heads.</p>

<p>"Halt, there!"</p>

<p>Behind them, entering by the door through
which Callister had turned to flee, a second posse
of police was seen, headed by the pale determined
figure of Detective Hook, while following
close behind were three ragged street boys, easily
recognized as our old friends Barney, the
bootblack, Sandy and Garibaldi the Bats in the
Wall.</p>

<p>"Those are your men, officers!" cried Frank,
in clear, ringing tones. "That's Callister&mdash;the
tall one by the door&mdash;that's the head of the gang
who robbed the Webster bank, and sought to
throw the crime on me!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Morning dawned upon the city of New York
with clearer skies so far as Frank Mansfield was
concerned, than he had known for months.</p>

<p>The end had come.</p>

<p>The mystery of the robbery of the Webster
bank was a mystery no more.</p>

<p>The rising sun found the virtuous Mr. Callister
and the two Cutts snugly ensconced in the
Tombs.</p>

<p>Before a force so overwhelming they had not
even tried to resist.</p>

<p>And then the whole thing came out, and the
newspapers rang with it next day.</p>

<p>It appeared that the first information of the
intended robbery of the Lispenard bank had been
given by Frank Mansfield, who walked boldly
into the office of the Chief of Police, told his
whole story and placed the plans found in the
coat of Callister in his hands.</p>

<p>It was upon information thus received that the
police secreted themselves in the bank after nightfall,
stationing the "Bats" to watch outside and
sound the alarm of the approach of the burglars
by their usual cry.</p>

<p>The arrival of Detective Hook had been an entirely
independent affair.</p>

<p>Reviving at last from his swoon, this brave
officer had escaped by the secret passage&mdash;an old
sewer beneath the Donegal Shades, used doubtless
by the scoundrels who frequented that den
for the conveyance of stolen goods&mdash;as we
have seen, and hurrying to the Oak street station
had made his story known, and started with
a number of policemen for the Lispenard bank.</p>

<p>Of their timely arrival we are already informed.</p>

<p>That the arrest of Callister made a tremendous
stir in financial circles need not be told.</p>

<p>But Frank Mansfield stands to-day rich, happy
and prosperous, his name justified before the
world.</p>

<p>The officers of the Webster bank now understand
his innocence, and would be only too glad
to receive him again into their employ.</p>

<p>But Frank has no need for further toil.</p>

<p>From beneath the ruins of the Three Oaks
there came forth a golden treasure which has
placed him beyond all fear of want.</p>

<p>For a round half million will do that and leave
some to spare, even in these expensive days,
and such proved to be the value of the gold
and gems buried by that strange old man, Jeremiah
Mansfield, in the cellar of the great house
where for so many years he dwelt alone.</p>

<p>During the search which took place at the
ruins, both Detective Hook and Frank's new-found
cousin, Jerry Buck, whose true name
proved to be Dupont Tisdale, assisted.</p>

<p>By Jerry the presence of Mrs. Mansfield at the
Three Oaks was made perfectly plain.</p>

<p>Familiar with the house and its secret passages
for years, she had, assisted by the boy,
played the ghost most successfully, gliding in
and out of the chamber of its former owner by
means of a secret panel set in the wall, while
the light&mdash;nothing more than the usual stage
fire&mdash;was used to add effect to the scene at the
suggestion of Jerry himself.</p>

<p>They found the iron chest without difficulty,
and the will having been placed in the hands
of the Surrogate of New York County, its contents
were turned over to that official to be
dealt with according to the law.</p>

<p>By the confession of Tisdale, all stain being
removed from the name of our hero, in due
time he came into his own.</p>

<p>And these two important points being settled,
nothing remains but to dispose of the principal
actors in this strange but true narrative of
events growing out of the robbery of the Webster
bank.</p>

<p>The body of Reuben Tisdale was recovered
from the sub-cellar beneath the Donegal Shades
upon the morning of the burglars' arrest.</p>

<p>In some unexplained manner, P. Slattery had
got wind of the affair, and deserting his saloon,
has never since been seen.</p>

<p>In due time, Elijah Callister, exposed in his
true colors before the world, paid the penalty of
his many crimes upon the scaffold in the yard of
the Tombs, which event occurring as it did only
a few months since, after a long and much talked
of trial, must still be fresh in the minds of all
who read this tale.</p>

<p>The Cutts, father and son, were sentenced to
Sing Sing on the testimony of Caleb Hook, for a
term of years.</p>

<p>Between the detective and Mr. Billy Cutts this
most effectually squared accounts.</p>

<p>For his services, so kindly and faithfully rendered,
as may be well believed, Frank Mansfield
saw this brave member of the New York detective
force fully repaid.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is rumored that so liberal was this
compensation, that there is no actual need for
Caleb Hook to continue on the force.</p>

<p>The papers given by Mrs. Mansfield to the detective
in the room in Cherry street proved to
be simply a desultory description of the history
of that unfortunate woman's past life.</p>

<p>Before his final resignation of the case he turned
them over to Frank, who having revised them
in the light of later disclosures, gave them to the
press, thereby clearing the name of his dead
father from all stain, Tisdale's confession rendering
it absolutely certain that the funds placed
in the hands of that unfortunate gentleman for
safe-keeping had been stolen by Callister and
himself.</p>

<p>The watchman of the Lispenard Bank, and
Flaherty, the "crooked" policeman on the beat
covering the Webster Bank, were tried together
for aiding and abetting the gang of burglars.</p>

<p>Against Mike, the watchman, the evidence was
conclusive, and he was sent to Sing Sing to keep
company with his friend Detective Cutts, but
Flaherty escaped for want of evidence, although
he was dismissed from the police force in disgrace.</p>

<p>Jim Morrow and Ed Wilson, Frank's fast companions,
who assisted Billy Cutts to betray him,
we presume remain still in California&mdash;at all
events we have heard nothing of them since.</p>

<p>Nor is this to be regretted.</p>

<p>Frank plays poker no more, and has no use for
any of their sort.</p>

<p>In an elegant mansion on one of the avenues,
Frank Mansfield lives with his mother, whose
reason is now fully restored.</p>

<p>With them dwells a young lady who seldom
appears in public, and dresses in the deepest
black.</p>

<p>It is Miss Edna Callister, who, while admitting
the justice of her father's punishment, still deplores
his fate.</p>

<p>Time, which cures all things, has, however, already
done its work for her, and it is commonly
rumored that at the expiration of the prescribed
year of mourning, her marriage with our hero
will be duly announced.</p>

<p>With them also dwells Jerry Buck, who is now
attending school, and endeavoring to make up
by hard study for the time lost during the years
spent as a waif in New York's streets.</p>

<p>The old vault beneath the grave-yard of Trinity
Church is deserted now&mdash;restored to its original
use, a burial place of the dead.</p>

<p>After the newspaper disclosures the boys could
not return there, of course, and Frank, mindful
of his promise, not only rewarded Barney, the
bootblack, Sandy and Garibaldi by a substantial
gift from his newly acquired wealth, but provided
for all the boys a comfortable home.</p>

<p>"For the result of these strange events," as he
remarked to us the other day, when we visited
him at his elegant home for additional particulars
to be incorporated in this tale, "might have
proved to be a very different affair had it not
been for the timely assistance afforded my mother
and myself by those kind-hearted street boys,
the '<span class="smcap">Bats in the Wall</span>.'"</p>
